      Main Floor Bathroom Remodel on a $5500 Budget: Planning StageThe main floor bathroom in this little cottage was icky. Built in 1947, it was predictable that the room would be small. Sadly, the 1970s update just made it depressing. Sure, it was all neutrals, but they were pretty beat up from years of college age renters. bathroom remodel 19047 in Valley Grove - A word of advice   Talking about bathroom remodel 19047 in Valley Grove Main bathroom. Tiny, no window, fiber glass shower surround, laminate counter, stained everything. Here’s what harshed my mellow: Top ideas for bathroom remodel 19047 in Valley Grove The whole thing was small, 7.5’x5.’ This is the kind of small that makes a person enraged when they hear about “small” 8×10′ bathrooms. I’m one of those people, people. The finishes were grotty. Laminate and fiberglass, they were on the beat up, scratched side. Faucet was limey/rusting, sink had permanent stains. The vanity was a problem. It jutted into the room, nailing my hip more than once. Dark and small, it added little storage but seemed to suck the life out of the room. The space was so tight, you couldn’t even put a TP holder in it, adjacent to the toilet. And it was LOW. Like back-breaking-think-I’ll-skip-washing-face-again low. I was a little in mourning. My last house had a nice, old, deep tub, and I am a bath taker. This one had a shallow, tiny tub, the opposite of inviting on a cold winter night. Or anytime. Lighting was grim. Ancient over-sink lighting and a fluorescent light integrated into the fan. No natural light because no window. Even though the bathroom backed onto an exterior wall. Just sad. And annoying. Time to see what could be done right away: A shower curtain was a given. The bathroom was so grotty that it just didn’t make sense to invest in a glass enclosure when it was so obvious that this would be the first major remodel. So I put in a curved double shower rod. Love those things! Extra elbow room in the small shower. An extra rack to hang stuff on. Double shower rod I also added a railway rack over the tub for in room towel storage. This would put clean towels in reach within the bathroom. With the linen closet at the other end of the hall and the undersink storage just gross, this was a high priority. Railway rack, cheapo version. I kinda don’t get why more people don’t put these over tubs. The storage improvement is seriously great. It provides a prefect, tidy place to leave wet wash cloths or hang the occasional dripping garment. And, if you think it makes the bathroom look too closed in at say, a party, all ya gotta do put the towels back in the linen closet and the rack sort of disappears. Next I swapped out the key-locking bathroom knob, anticipating the day a niece or nephew would accidentally lock themselves in the windowless room. This was my first little egg knob. Love it! A classic look but easier to use than a conventional round one. Prettier than the weird, crusted, keyed door knob. A happy, child-safe little egg knob. Sadly, that was pretty much it. I tried, I really tried to make it work. Scrubbed till I bled. Tried to overcome that feeling of distaste that I felt every time I walked in the bathroom. Told myself that bathing under a too low shower head was OK. Pretended that a bath with only ten inches of water was still a great way to relax. This thing needed an overhaul. Of course, the big question was, what would that overhaul cost? I really had no idea and budget was an issue. So the first step was be to identify every single improvement I anticipated making, including finish choices. And then I would ask the contractor. And then we’d see. Maybe something could be done. Maybe nothing. Here’s what we did on a total budget of around $5500, including the window. The contractor I used was The Pros of Idaho (), who were referred to me by my realtor. Everything they did came in on budget and on time. Everything they subbed out was to a licensed, bonded contractor. When I specified something a little weird, they asked me about it, helping me to correct course or working with my preferences. During the actual work phase, they were kind of obsessed with cleaning up EVERY DAY, which I thought was refreshingly funny. Or maybe just an illustration of how low your standards can go when you live with seven animals. If you’d like to skip the planning details and see how it all turned out, bounce over . Look and feel. Given resources and the style, age, and neighborhood, I just didn’t think that finishes needed to be extreme to provide a great, functional, in-keeping-with-era bathroom. I prefer older style bathrooms, ones that look crisp, light and fresh. White porcelain, clean metals. That works for me. Wall paint is how I prefer to add and subtract bathroom color, keeping the permanent stuff as classic and simple as possible. My goal was to put in a bathroom that might have been original with just a few modern tweaks. Function. With such a small space for the primary bathroom for the whole house, basic function, storage and navigability were top issues. Pretty was secondary, though of course on the wish list. Function choices are discussed in more detail below. Another function note: this is both the main bathroom for everyone AND the guest bathroom. So it was important to make organization/storage choices that would make the bathroom easy to use and virtually always guest ready. New window: The room needed a window. Totally ridiculous to have a exterior wall adjacent room of any kind without a window. No wonder the bathroom seemed dank. To be fair, there was no mold. Yet really, it felt like mold was invited but too busy or repulsed to come to the party. Because of where the house is, this window had to be approved by the historical society so there was not much choice about how this window would look. We ended up with a narrow, high, bottom opening casement, which works great. Light comes in. No one can see in. The Professionals of Idaho installed the window for a very fair price, and did the rest of the bathroom as well. The window was my single biggest splurge at $625. It now also lights the hall, worth every penny. Tub or Shower? In a small bathroom, going only shower can make a lot of sense. But this was the primary bath in the house. The other, basement bath had a shower only and was even smaller than this room. I like a good soak, feels great. Kids, who visit often, need a tub. Resale value suggests at least one functioning bathtub in a house is a smart idea. Bath tub it was.  I picked the for these reasons: Depth of soak Liked look Would fit tiny space   Glass enclosure or shower curtain? Generally I prefer glass. However, it’s more costly and in that small space, a bit unwieldy. By this time, I had fallen in love with my curved shower curtain rod so it seemed wisest to just reuse it, only this time, mount it higher. Toilet: Needed a new one, hopefully a lot prettier, with a higher seat and soft close.    This seemed like its lines would not fight with the tub: Plus I loved the flip up handle and flat top.  Sink: Originally I wanted from Foremost Series 1930, with a simple integrated backsplash. But it was out of stock when I needed it so we went with this number, to match the tub. I don’t love it as much as the 30s look but it does look great and clean. A word about pedestal sinks. Some folks don’t get them, citing lost storage space. Here’s why they’re worth considering: Clean, classic look With wide rim, some functional surface space is available but not enough to invite clutter Great in small footprint bathroom, where there’s not space to go big or a vanity would darken and shrink the space (and be hard to get into) Helpful when maneuvering wheelchair & walker using guests Often higher than a conventional vanity Fixtures: For most of the bath and sink fixtures, we went with Moen Banbury. It had the right cottage look to it. In brushed nickel, water stains wouldn’t show much, which is a really big deal to me. For the main towel rack, I went double to maximize storage. Railway rack: I upgraded my el cheapo interim rack with the . Much sturdier, no water spots to show and super handy hooks. This baby was worth every penny. Redi Niche: I got two of these inserts. They fit in between the studs and get tiled over to add extra storage. One is on the wall facing the door. The other under the railway rack. This gives me and guests plenty of storage room. These babies do come in other convenient sizes. I just liked the double shelf. For a change, I had one installed with the small shelf on top, the other as shown below. Part of me wishes I’d gone for even more between the studs niches here just to max out storage options. In real life, the two niches are plenty for me. Tile: I went classic with the tile. White subway for the tub enclosure and white hex for the floor. Baseboards out of white subway. Grey grout on the floor, light grout on the walls. Medicine cabinet: There were so many straight lines already in the bathroom, I went with an oval to break things up. had the convenience of a mirror inside. And, in this small space, I love that it’s recessed.   Over toilet storage/glass shelves: I wanted to use glass shelves over the toilet. They could be used for display, add guest convenience, hold a lot of stuff when needed and disappear when not. I went with three of Delta’s in satin nickel. The look seemed like it would work OK with all the Moen Banbury fixtures AND I really wanted that spot-free satin nickel finish. The Banbury glass shelves were pretty but I disliked the mounting with it’s bump, which gave up too much shelf space. In a perfect world, I’d have shelves with a little rim around them because of my klutz issue. However, at the time of shopping, all I could find in that style were chrome, or shelves that were only 20.” They might not be a perfect match, but I love these babies. They are serious work horses, able to hold up to 35lbs of stuff. Main Supplies Storage: This required a lot of thought. The first thing I made my peace with was that without a vanity, cleaning supplies would need to live elsewhere. Then I found from the Family Handyman and it made ALL THE DIFFERENCE. Seriously, every time I see a small bathroom solutions article, I think someone else will have done this, it is so perfect. It’s not just that it allowed me to ditch the awkward, unopenable vanity; it gave me more and more functional storage! At this point, my DIY skills were not equal to tearing out the wall and putting this in. I’m ok with a lot of imperfections in my projects but for a heavy use bathroom, I wanted it built right. I asked the guys at the Pros of Idaho if they could do it. Waited with dread to hear the pricing and it came in at . . . about $300. Deal! The vanity could go the way of the dodo bird and I’d still get some good storage. Once all this was priced and planned, work began in earnest. Here are some work in progress shots. If you’d like to skip on to see how it all turned out, and how it’s holding up almost two years later, go . Up next: Have you done a bathroom remodel? Did you enjoy researching and choosing the fixtures? Supply challenges? Did you DIY or use a contractor? Regrets?

      On the off chance that you stroll into your washroom in the morning and 
      simply moan, this is a decent sign that a remodel might be what you 
      require. There might be only one thing, similar to that revolting old 
      bathtub, that makes you hate the way the room looks and the fortunate 
      thing around a lavatory redesign is that you can change as much or as 
      meager as you prefer. You can visit
