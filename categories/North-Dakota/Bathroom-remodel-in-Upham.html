      Bathroom Remodel Project: RevealGood Morning! Talking about bathroom remodel 77379 in Upham After weeks literally 6 weeks of spending numerous hours helping my sister remodel her bathroom I’m thrilled to announce…we are done! Where to find more information on bathroom remodel 77379 in Upham Can I just say that again…WE ARE DONE!!! bathroom remodel 77379 in Upham - A word of advice You have no idea how good that feels to say 🙂 In case this is your first time stopping by I have been participating in the  series where bloggers and designers make-over a room, and update their progress each week for 6 weeks.  You can check out our bathroom remodeling journey here: , , , & . So without further ado it’s finally time to check out this “new” bathroom!! I think we stayed pretty true to our spa-inspired bathroom vision…don’t you? And the whole look of the bathroom has changed so much… But definitely for the better 🙂 Even though we experienced our fair share of struggles with this challenge I really had a great time participating. But…I am glad we are done and have a pretty bathroom to show from it! Now…I’d like to thank a few important people: First I’d like to extend a big thank you to Linda from for organizing the challenge. I had so much fun interacting with all of the bloggers and designers that participated each week. I made some really cool new friends, and am excited to continue to follow along with their blogs and latest projects. Speaking of which…if you haven’t seen their final reveals yet you have to check them out To my fearless crew aka Mom & Dad – thank you for teaching us how to do things we’ve never attempted before like hanging wallpaper, and installing a faucet. I’m pretty confident this bathroom would still be painted chartreuse if it wasn’t for your guidance. Side note: for those of you wondering about my dad’s concussion he’s doing much better…and was able to help install the faucets…yay!!! And last but not least…my sissy, Kelli! Thanks for letting me share your bathroom remodel with the world. I hope you enjoy your “new” space. And I hope you all have enjoyed this challenge as much I did! Have a great day!

The wallpaper and the paint color are so soothing and just beautiful…and to think you did that all yourself! Amazing! Bravo. xo November 7, 2014 at 7:32 am (2 years ago) Thanks, Celine!

The wallpaper is an amazing feature, and I think I’ve told you this a million times, but I STILL love the ceiling height shower curtains. Oh, and the purple is perfect! November 7, 2014 at 3:13 pm (2 years ago) Thanks, Melissa! That’s ok…it’s still nice to hear that you like the shower curtains 🙂 janis November 8, 2014 at 10:00 am (2 years ago) that is such a dramatic change and everything goes together so nicely. really like the color and wallpaper design, and the curtains add to the finish which i have a question about….are they only for show and do you still have the clear shower curtains behind them? November 10, 2014 at 6:51 am (2 years ago) Thanks, Janis! There is a clear shower curtain behind the others to pull when showering. The white ones are just for décor purposes 🙂 jen June 17, 2015 at 9:27 am (11 months ago) My question is if you have really long decorative curtains and use the pole for that then where is the pole for the liner and liners are short so how would it fit in the tub up that high???? thanks June 18, 2015 at 2:30 pm (11 months ago) We actually have a two-in-one pole, one for the curtains and one for the liner. You can’t really tell there are two poles unless you get super close to it. They also sell long liners and that is what we used for this shower. Hope that helps 🙂 November 8, 2014 at 10:24 pm (2 years ago) Pretty, pretty, pretty! It looks lovely and yay for mom and dad. Great job. November 10, 2014 at 6:48 am (2 years ago) Thanks, Linda! I had a great time participating in the challenge. Thanks again for hosting it 🙂 November 10, 2014 at 12:09 am (2 years ago) Love the wall colour and wallpaper and the family effort. Your sister must be very happy! And sorry to hear about your Dad but glad he’s OK. November 10, 2014 at 6:47 am (2 years ago) Thanks, Vanessa! Glad you like it. Thanks for your kind words about my Dad too 🙂 November 10, 2014 at 4:46 pm (2 years ago) the color turned out so perfect! it just looks amazing, perfect accessories…perfect accents. great job. hope to see you back at the spring ORC! November 10, 2014 at 5:54 pm (2 years ago) Thank you! I’ll start brainstorming about the Spring challenge now 🙂 November 16, 2014 at 11:34 am (2 years ago) First, sorry I’m just now getting over here! I hit publish on my room and ran out the door on vacation. Secondly…yay Erin!!! I love this bathroom (and so glad to hear your dad is doing better). Love the double long shower curtain and that gorgeous wallpaper make the room! I also love your accessories and styling…that stool is to die for. Well done!!! November 16, 2014 at 12:11 pm (2 years ago) No worries! Thanks for all of the sweet comments, Kate 🙂 Shelly February 2, 2015 at 9:23 am (1 year ago) So beautiful, what kind of fabric did you use to make the shower curtains? theblueeyeddove@gmail.com February 3, 2015 at 11:17 pm (1 year ago) The fabric is a polyester/stain blend Shelly. Hope that helps 🙂 2Pingbacks & Trackbacks on Bathroom Remodel Project: Reveal says: […] case you have already forgotten about my Sister’s fab new bathroom here it […] says: […] Bathroom Remodel Project: Reveal […] Leave a Reply

      On the off chance that you stroll into your washroom in the morning and 
      simply moan, this is a decent sign that a remodel might be what you 
      require. There might be only one thing, similar to that revolting old 
      bathtub, that makes you hate the way the room looks and the fortunate 
      thing around a lavatory redesign is that you can change as much or as 
      meager as you prefer. You can visit <a href="http://www.artisanbathrooms.com">http://www.artisanbathrooms.com</a>
