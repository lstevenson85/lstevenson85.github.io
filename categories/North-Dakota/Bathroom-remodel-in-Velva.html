      Bathroom Remodel RevealYesterday I shared and realized that I hadn’t shared the finished Bathroom Remodel.  Yikes!  It has definitely been a crazy summer! Where to find more information on bathroom remodel 77388 in Velva [pinterest] Talking about bathroom remodel 77388 in Velva This all started back in May.  You can see what it looked like before . Top ideas for bathroom remodel 77388 in Velva I even had a on .  Which by the way was a great way for me to convey to my contractor what I wanted done.  Oh, we hired this out.  Keith and I are not DIY’ers and with what we wanted done, we needed someone that knew what they were doing. So, let me say I am just thrilled with the results.  The bathroom footprint could not be changed and it is small.  What I needed was something fresh with as much storage as possible.  Mission accomplished. We retiled the floor and inside the tub area.  We removed the tile from the bottom of the walls and added a board and batten finish.  The upper walls and ceiling were painted two different shades of light gray with the darker on the wall and lighter on the ceiling.  We replaced the old vanity lights and added a fan with light along with electrical outlets.  Yup, this puppy did not have any electrical outlets. We replaced the toilet with a newer, more efficient model in white (no more beige) and added a bigger vanity with these two pieces from .  I had wanted to have something custom built because I wanted a hamper on the side of the vanity and my contractor found these for me and saved me lots of money.  I made the storage cabinet on the right into a hamper and shared that on the blog . The basket is from Walmart.  It matches some others that I am using and it allows Keith to have a place to store his razor and charger without them being out in the open.  Behind the plant (which is one of the many that I received while I was in the hospital) is our electrical outlet.  The plant is surviving so far.  Between Pixie, Dixie and me, most plants don’t do well in our house. Above the vanity we had our contractor take our old medicine cabinet and totally revamp it by recessing it into the wall. Previously it was mounted on the wall and had quite a bit of decorative trim around it.  Placing it in the wall and removing all that trim gave us about 6 extra inches of personal space above the sink.  It makes a huge difference. And here is he lighting we chose from Home Depot.  The lighting is much better than the old fixture we had. I told you that I needed more storage? Well, our contractor built this cute little cabinet for us just for that purpose.  He modeled it after one that I had pinned and mounted it to look like it was an old add on from long ago. It is perfect for storing extra rolls or TP and other little essentials. The shelf is adjustable.  The cotton balls are stored in an old jar that Keith has owned forever.  The old glass liquor decanter stores mouthwash and the little crystal jar houses Q-tips. He added a towel rack, too.  And that little crystal dish with matches on the toilet was picked up at the same yard sale as the other crystal dish and glass decanter.  I got a box of crystal and glass for $5 and you know how I love to use . And the top has a nice place to display things that we don’t want Pixie and Dixie messing with.  Like the , the Seashell Décor from yesterday’s post and my cat that I brought back from Switzerland.  He reminded me of our cat Shadow and I just had to bring him home with me. The hydrangeas are from last year’s crop.  I love how the dry to a creamy rose color. The stained glass window is an old find from an antique show many years ago.  We have had it in this window since we moved here.  The way our bathroom is situated, you don’t really need curtains and this old window’s pimpled glass gives you extra privacy while letting in much needed light. The Celtic pieces above are reproduction pieces I purchased on my trip to Ireland in 2007.  Keith and I love Celtic work and for some reason they just fit here. The Seashell Art on the left is the first art we did with our friends that we go to the beach with.  We made those back in 2003, little did we know what it would lead to!  All we did was take terra cotta clay pot bases and glue in our shells with caulk.  We sprinkled sand on them to cover the caulk.  Then we sprayed with sealer and that was it. And to the left of those is the we made last year. I love how this turned out. Here you can see more of the board and batten wall finish and some of the tile floor.  The tile has a white base with gray and tan veins running through it. The floor tile has a matte finish and the matching wall tile has a glossy finish.  We totally redid the shower plumbing, moving it from the tub to the wall.  The tub, which is not shown, was not replaced.  It is a nice cast iron porcelain and I did not want to replace it with fiberglass or anything else we saw that was affordable.  We may have it re-glazed in white some day, but right now, it ties in perfectly with the hints of tan in the tile and the tan color of the manufactured stone counter tops of the vanity. We did have our contractor add two little niches in the wall to give us extra space in the shower for shampoos and other items.  And he added the ceramic soap shelves in the front corner.  No more crazy metal pole shelves that do nothing but rust! On the narrow strip of wall by the door is another of our Seaside Art pieces.  This one showcases some of Keith’s Shark’s Teeth.  Where I look for Seashells, he looks for Shark’s Teeth.  He has gotten really good at finding them and it is a great way to spend a couple of hours walking up and down the beach. I think I found the frame at Walmart, many years ago.  The cardstock is just some scrapbook paper with a glitter finish and then I used some rub on letters to add the beach name. For towels, we decided to use hooks instead of bars.  They take up less space and you can get more hung this way.  We used three on this wall behind the door and two on the back of the door. Speaking of the door, all of the doors in our house are original.  And they all have this finish, which is in pretty good condition, considering the house is 50+ years old.  Our contractor recommended we leave them since it was another way to bring in the tan, natural tone to the room.  But, he did find my shelf inspiration on Pinterest and added one above the door so I could take advantage of more, much needed space. The two baskets on the ends are from Walmart, they match the one in the vanity.  The one in the center is from Michaels and it coordinates nicely. The baskets came with the little chalkboard labels attached.  I debated on whether or not to label them, and in the end decided to rob my stash of Seashells and hot glue these on instead. I found some tan colored shells and was able to make them look like little handles in a way. The baskets house items that we use such as shaving gels, bath gels and hygiene products.  They are close but out of sight.  I usually stock up on these items when I have coupons and will have quite a bit on hand, so these baskets work really well for that purpose. Well, there you have it.  I told you it was a small room.  But I am so happy about how it all turned out.  Our contractor was great!  He was able to pick out my wants from my Pinterest board and bring them to life.  We have a brighter, fresher bathroom with more storage and it even feels like we have more space!  We also are able to showcase personal collectibles and art in our newly remodeled bathroom!  It took a while to finish, but it was so worth it!  We really love it!

      On the off chance that you stroll into your washroom in the morning and 
      simply moan, this is a decent sign that a remodel might be what you 
      require. There might be only one thing, similar to that revolting old 
      bathtub, that makes you hate the way the room looks and the fortunate 
      thing around a lavatory redesign is that you can change as much or as 
      meager as you prefer. You can visit <a href="http://www.allbathroomgear.com.au/">http://www.allbathroomgear.com.au/</a>
