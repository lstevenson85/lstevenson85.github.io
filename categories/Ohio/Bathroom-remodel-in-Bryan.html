      Main Floor Bathroom Remodel on a $5500 Budget: The TourOriginal main bathroom. Natural light now washes the bathroom. The updated bath is a hard working space, more functional, and light, with touches of pretty. Getting the most out of bathroom remodel under 1000 in Bryan And now, here’s the blow-by-blow on my choices and how they worked out. Talking about bathroom remodel under 1000 in Bryan Before we start, here’s a truth in advertising note: The bathroom got its routine weekly cleaning but it hasn’t been staged. I wanted to show how I actually live every day in this space. My have really made it possible to keep this space tidy with almost zero effort. Sometimes I get more minimalist and stow the stuff out on the shelves but mostly not. In real life, it doesn’t feel cluttered when I’m in the space. bathroom remodel under 1000 in Bryan - A word of advice Paint: The colors I chose were Tahoe Snow and my standard “house white,” aka Country Cotton, both Kelly-Moore. Mostly I wanted the room to be fresh and light feeling. It’s a water room as well, so icy blue seemed like a perfect almost-neutral. Sometimes it’s dressed with pale blue and white towels. Sometimes I get all Scandinavian and use rich red towels. I went with semi-gloss paint on the icy blue. I like the way it looks and contrasts with the shiny porcelain fixtures. That said, I can’t help feeling like a glossier paint would be more durable. Humph. In retrospect, if I had kids, the paint would need to be a durable high gloss. In reality, it’s holding up just fine. Curtain rod & shower curtain: We raised the shower rod as high as possible and that meant needing an extra long shower curtain. I like a cotton external shower curtain and a vinyl or plastic liner. Well, like on that last part is too strong. I find the liner useful. Buying an extra long liner was pretty simple. They carry them at places like Home Depot but I got a discount version at Ross. The shower curtain was a bigger problem. I wanted white, something classic looking and long enough to drape prettily on the outside of the tub. But, after investing in the big remodel, I just couldn’t stomach dropping $50+ on the extra long shower curtains I found. I didn’t really like any of them. I wanted something that would sort of disappear, unless you really looked at it. And then there should be a surprise. A DIY shower curtain should not be a problem, right? If anything is easy to sew, a straight seam in some cotton should be it. Still,  I also was feeling too lazy to actually sew anything. round up of DIY shower curtains got me started. Measuring, I realized that the size of fabric I needed was basically a flat, full-sized sheet, which would eliminate the sewing requirement. Holes could easily be handled with a grommet kit. And I could make it my own by using fabric ink to stamp some sea monsters along the bottom. More details in . I love my sea monster border.   Hopefully you can see here how high the shower rod is. For extra privacy, the curtain can be drawn but nothing actually overlooks the window so the shower curtain is always left open. New window:  The window was better than I hoped. Sure, it was a conventional, simple shape. Instantly it lit the whole room and cast light into the formerly dark hallway. Even at dusk, the need to turn on a hallway light is eliminated. And ventilation. Who hates that? Finally, it should be said that the window ledge is handy for storage as well. I don’t seem to need it in this space but the occasional guest appreciates it. Even at dusk, there’s no need to flip on a light now that there’s a window. The hall also benefits from the new window’s light. Shower surround inserts: These really add a lot of easy-use storage space. In one insert, there are body washes. In the other, big pump bottles of shampoo and conditioner. The smaller shelves are perfect for soap and razors.   Here’s a closeup of an insert. Railway rack: When I have guests, I put towels on the railway rack for easy access. In everyday life, I don’t bother. But I do use the little hooks to dry wet wash cloths, and hand other miscellaneous stuff. So, so handy. And because it’s so high, it doesn’t cramp anyone’s style in the bathroom. See earlier pic. Over-toilet storage:  I went with three of these glass shelves, which are rated to hold 35lbs each. I store my prettier, everyday use things here. It might look cleaner without the decor items, but I like seeing them. I try to keep a flower in my mom’s crystal bud vase. Even flower free, I love looking at it. When overnight guests come, I store the stuff on the middle shelf in my cabinet to free up a shelf. About 1/3 of the items on the shelf are purely decorative and can easily be put somewhere else if space is needed or I just want to de-clutter. The top of the toilet is used for clean wash cloths and a little air freshener. Yes, that’s my mom’s old silver-plated bread basket. I use it more here than at the dining table. Utility items: Extra TP, waste basket, plunger, cleaning supplies and more . . . These items all need a place and a plan to keep a bathroom comfortable and functional. Much of it used to be stowed in the awful vanity, which put them in the right room though the vanity was still hard to excavate in the tiny space. Now they each have a specific solution. Three extra toilet paper rolls live in a covered canister. The cats would prefer a more open container but I am ruthless. Go for one that can hold those extra fat rolls. The trash can is small and has a step-open feature. Extra liners are kept inside the can. Here’s something I find ever-baffling: why doesn’t everyone use covered waste cans in a bathroom? Who wants to see that waste? I splurged on a Simple Human magnetic sleeve plunger. This keeps it clean and away from touching anything else. It lives against the wall by the toilet. And actually, the new toilet is so great it’s never been used in the almost two years since the remodel. The hair dryer lives on a hook under the sink. It’s easy to plug in, easy to stow. Cleaning supplies live under another sink, in their own little tub. Once a week I have to walk fifteen extra steps to retrieve the cleaning box. Wash cloths and extra towels each have a place to live. Wash cloths sit in a silver-plated bread basket on top of the toilet, handy to the sink. Extra towels are placed on the railway rack when company is in town and back in the linen closet when they’re not needed. The railway rack does double duty for drying clothes inside in the winter. Outside the door storage. I’ve often thought of putting a little table in the hall corner, outside the bathroom door. I haven’t yet, because the current storage options cover my needs. Extra toilet paper canister, covered waste bin, tucked between sink and toilet. Simple Human plunger, so far never used. If the occasional nosy guest really wants to know where my hair dryer is, they have only to look under the sink. Enjoy! It’s a tiny space! Only include the stuff you touch everyday. Cleaning supplies can lurk somewhere else. Medicine cabinet: This lovely piece is dedicated to holding tooth supplies. I like these stowed away from the rest of the germs circulating in any bathroom. In almost two years, we’ve never had an issue with the toothbrushes not drying out due to being in the cabinet. It’s also nice that the cabinet has mirrors outside and in. The one flaw is that the magnetic holder that’s supposed to help the cabinet stay closed has come unglued. Since it has no problem staying closed, I haven’t bothered to fix it. Medicine cabinet over the sink. Sink rim is big enough to hold soap and lotion. Forgive the crazy lighting! I’ll try again when it’s daylight. Decor items: I think a little pretty in a small room somehow grounds it or makes me take it more seriously. And then I mess it up less. Above the towel rack, I put one of my favorite jellyfish illustrations. On another wall, I hung an antique silver mirror found at the Paris flea markets, a comb my grandmother wore, a favorite night light, and an evil eye amulet I brought home from Egypt. It makes me happy to see these things. A favorite jellyfish over the double towel rack. Treasures add interest to the little wall alongside the door. Antique — and tarnished — silver mirror found at a Paris flea market. I still love it, S! Antique comb and an evil eye amulet I picked up in Egypt. Using my good things in the bathroom means I see them more. I love seeing my mom’s crystal bud vase everyday. Lighting: This didn’t go the way I thought it would. Turns out, my ceiling is too low so, in order to have the medicine cabinet open property, the light fixture had to be flipped to point at the ceiling. It’s still plenty bright, if a little silly looking. Mostly it’s only turned on at night because there’s so much light coming in from the window. Flipped over lights Most wonderful cabinet in the world: Now for the cabinet that really makes this space work. As I mentioned, the recipe came from . For mine, there would only be room to put one cabinet in and not the double glass one Family Handyman shows. I wanted mine to have a door that closed but glass wouldn’t have that might-be-original-to-the-house look. Esvin from the Pros of Idaho () made it work perfectly, even adding a little egg knob to match the door knob. This shallow cabinet is great because it allows you to see everything you need without rummaging about. Shelves are adjustable. It’s plenty big to store immediately needed supplies, including all that annoying pretty girl stuff. Extras live in a bin in the linen closet and are replenished as needed. I’m so enchanted by this guy two years later that even if I weren’t remodeling the tiniest bathroom in the world, I’d put one in. Outside of the between-the-studs cabinet from Family Handyman plan. Between studs cabinet inside. Note that the shelves are adjustable. And now a smug cabinet note: a month after the bathroom was finished, I was browsing a Restoration Hardware catalog. There I saw a between-the-studs long mirrored medicine cabinet! Same size as mine. Beautiful. And $900. Guess they’re reading Family Handyman too! Tile: As you’ll have seen, white tile was the plan. Larger subway tiles were used in the shower and hex tiles on the floor. There’s no back splash because when I originally planned the bathroom, the pedestal sink had a built in back splash. And now I’m on the fence about whether to add one. What do you think? Hex floor tiles with gray grout. Subway tile was used instead of baseboard. Two regrets: I wish it had been easy/feasible/affordable to add another outlet. The space is just so tiny that it didn’t seem workable. And the truth is, two outlets has always been just fine. It’s not like a bunch of people can stand around in the bathroom together. So this might be simple greed talking. I dropped almost $100 on the special stopper/plug that goes with the Archer tub. It looked great but within a couple of months, I noticed that it just wasn’t stopping up the water. It was one of those twist down jobs that you can’t always be sure are working. Instead of getting a full tub of hot water, I got a slow-to-fill tub of lukewarm. Fiddling with it a few times got it working again, but inconsistently. Quite annoying, the opposite of how you want to feel at bath time. And not water wise! Eventually, I just unscrewed it. Now when I want to take a bath, I pull out the rubber stopper I picked up at the dollar store and it works perfectly. And that’s about it! What do you think? Ideas for smarter choices? Would you add a back splash behind the sink? If so, made of what? Thanks for taking the remodeled bathroom tour!

      On the off chance that you stroll into your washroom in the morning and 
      simply moan, this is a decent sign that a remodel might be what you 
      require. There might be only one thing, similar to that revolting old 
      bathtub, that makes you hate the way the room looks and the fortunate 
      thing around a lavatory redesign is that you can change as much or as 
      meager as you prefer. You can visit <a href="http://www.kbswrenovations.ca">http://www.kbswrenovations.ca</a>
